Breaking! A Typology of Security and Privacy News and How It's Shared,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656579,"news coverage of security and privacy (s&p) events is pervasive and may affect the salience of s&p threats to the public. to better understand this coverage and its effects, we asked: what types of s&p news come into people's awareness? how do people hear about and share this news? over two years, we recruited 1999 participants to fill out a survey on emergent s&p news events. we identified four types of s&p news: financial data breaches, corporate personal data breaches, high sensitivity systems breaches, and politicized / activist cybersecurity. these event types strongly correlated with how people shared s&p news-e.g., financial data breaches were shared most (42%), while politicized / activist cybersecurity events were shared least (21%). furthermore, participants' age, gender and security behavioral intention strongly correlated with how they heard about and shared s&p news-e.g., males more often felt a personal responsibility to share, and older people were less likely to hear about s&p news through conversation.",0
Deep Thermal Imaging: Proximate Material Type Recognition in the Wild through Deep Learning of Spatial Surface Temperature Patterns,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656570,"we introduce deep thermal imaging, a new approach for close-range automatic recognition of materials to enhance the understanding of people and ubiquitous technologies of their proximal environment. our approach uses a low-cost mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone to capture thermal textures. a deep neural network classifies these textures into material types. this approach works effectively without the need for ambient light sources or direct contact with materials. furthermore, the use of a deep learning network removes the need to handcraft the set of features for different materials. we evaluated the performance of the system by training it to recognize 32 material types in both indoor and outdoor environments. our approach produced recognition accuracies above 98% in 14,860 images of 15 indoor materials and above 89% in 26,584 images of 17 outdoor materials. we conclude by discussing its potentials for real-time use in hci applications and future directions.",1
All Work and No Play?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656571,"many conversational agents (cas) are developed to answer users' questions in a specialized domain. in everyday use of cas, user experience may extend beyond satisfying information needs to the enjoyment of conversations with cas, some of which represent playful interactions. by studying a field deployment of a human resource chatbot, we report on users' interest areas in conversational interactions to inform the development of cas. through the lens of statistical modeling, we also highlight rich signals in conversational interactions for inferring user satisfaction with the instrumental usage and playful interactions with the agent. these signals can be utilized to develop agents that adapt functionality and interaction styles. by contrasting these signals, we shed light on the varying functions of conversational interactions. we discuss design implications for cas, and directions for developing adaptive agents based on users' conversational behaviors.",2
Designing the Desirable Smart Home: A Study of Household Experiences and Energy Consumption Impacts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656572,"research has shown that desirable designs shape the use and experiences people have when interacting with technology. nevertheless, how desirability influences energy consumption is often overlooked, particularly in hci studies evaluating the sustainability benefits of smart home technology. in this paper, we present a qualitative study with 23 australian households who reflect on their experiences of living with smart home devices. drawing on nelson and stolterman's concept of desiderata we develop a typology of householders' desires for the smart home and their energy implications. we structure these desires as three smart home personas: the helper, optimiser and hedonist, which align with desiderata's three approaches to desire (reason, ethics and aesthetics). we use these insights to discuss how desirability can be used within hci for steering design of the smart home towards sustainability.",3
The Making of Performativity in Designing [with] Smart Material Composites,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656573,"as the material becomes active in disclosing the fullness of its capabilities, the boundaries between human and nonhuman performances are destabilized in productive practices that take their departure from materials. this paper illuminates the embodied crafting of action possibilities in material-driven design (mdd) practices with electroluminescent materials. the paper describes and discusses aspects of the making process of electroluminescent materials in which matter, structure, form, and computation are manipulated to deliberately disrupt the affordance of the material, with the goal to explore unanticipated action possibilities and materialize the performative qualities of the sample. in light of this account, the paper concludes by urging the hci community to performatively rupture the material, so to be able to act upon it as if it was always unfinished or underdeveloped. this, it is shown, can help open up the design space of smart material composites and reveal their latent affordances.",4
Patterns for How Users Overcome Obstacles in Voice User Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656574,"voice user interfaces (vuis) are growing in popularity. however, even the most current vuis regularly cause frustration for their users. very few studies exist on what people do to overcome vui problems they encounter, or how vuis can be designed to aid people when these problems occur. in this paper, we analyze empirical data on how users (n=12) interact with our vui calendar system, discovercal, over three sessions. in particular, we identify the main obstacle categories and types of tactics our participants employ to overcome them. we analyzed the patterns of how different tactics are used in each obstacle category. we found that while nlp error obstacles occurred the most, other obstacles are more likely to frustrate or confuse the user. we also found patterns that suggest participants were more likely to employ a ""guessing"" approach rather than rely on visual aids or knowledge recall.",5
ThinkActive: Designing for Pseudonymous Activity Tracking in the Classroom,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656585,"we report on the design of thinkactive - a system to encourage primary aged school children to reflect on their own personal activity data in the classroom. we deployed the system with a cohort of 30 school children, over a six-week period, in partnership with an english premier league football club's health and nutrition programme. the system utilizes inexpensive activity trackers and pseudonymous avatars to promote reflection with personal data using an in-situ display within the classroom. our design explores pseudonymity as an approach to managing privacy and personal data within a public setting. we report on the motivations, challenges, and opportunities for students, teachers, and third-party providers to engage in the collection and sharing of activity data with primary school children.",6
Gender Recognition or Gender Reductionism?: The Social Implications of Embedded Gender Recognition Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656586,"automatic gender recognition (agr) refers to various computational methods that aim to identify an individual's gender by extracting and analyzing features from images, video, and/or audio. applications of agr are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. however, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards agr and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. to begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards agr. we found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards agr and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. they raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. we present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems.",7
CivilServant: Community-Led Experiments in Platform Governance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656587,"as online platforms monitor and intervene in the daily lives of billions of people, platforms are being used to govern enduring social problems. field experiments could inform wise uses of this power if tensions between democratic values and experimentation could be resolved. in this paper, we introduce civilservant, a novel experimentation infrastructure that online communities and their moderators use to evaluate policies and replicate each others' findings. we situate civilservant in the political history of policy experiments and present design considerations for community participation, ethics, and replication. based on two case studies of community-led experiments and public debriefings on the reddit platform, we share findings on community deliberation about experiment results. we also report on uses of evidence, finding that experiments informed moderator practices, community policies, and replications by communities and platforms. we discuss the implications of these findings for evaluating platform governance in an open, democratic, experimenting society.",8
M-Kulinda: Using a Sensor-Based Technology Probe to Explore Domestic Security in Rural Kenya,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656588,"in rural kenyan households, property theft is a persistent problem. to explore how information and communication technologies (icts) may be used to address this problem we designed and deployed ""m-kulinda""-a sensor-based technology probe. we used interview, observation, diary, and data logging methods to understand 20 households' experiences using the system. our findings suggest that a probe's approach is useful in this context, more specifically we found that participants used our system in different ways to address their specific needs (e.g., monitoring poultry, electronics, and their family members). we also observed changes in our participants' understanding of sensors; m-kulinda prompted them to reflect on other areas where sensors could be used in their households. we present design implications based on these findings, and offer new perspectives on the role of technology in deterring crime.",9
Nonvisual Interaction Techniques at the Keyboard Surface,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656589,"web user interfaces today leverage many common gui design patterns, including navigation bars and menus (hierarchical structure), tabular content presentation, and scrolling. these visual-spatial cues enhance the interaction experience of sighted users. however, the linear nature of screen translation tools currently available to blind users make it difficult to understand or navigate these structures. we introduce spatial region interaction techniques (sprites) for nonvisual access: a novel method for navigating two-dimensional structures using the keyboard surface. sprites 1) preserve spatial layout, 2) enable bimanual interaction, and 3) improve the end user experience. we used a series of design probes to explore different methods for keyboard surface interaction. our evaluation of sprites shows that three times as many participants were able to complete spatial tasks with sprites than with their preferred current technology.",10
Admixed Portrait: Design to Understand Facebook Portrayals in New Parenthood,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656580,"we report on a design-led study of the photographic representation of self and family on facebook during and after becoming parents for the first time. our experience-centered, research-through-design study engaged eight participants across five uk homes, in a month-long deployment of a prototype technology -- a design research artifact, admixed portrait, that served to prompt participant reflection on first-time parenthood. in addition to pre- and post-deployment interviews, participants kept diaries capturing personal reflections during the deployment, on daily social media use and interactions with admixed. our qualitative insights on social media representations of transitional experience and identity for new parents, reveal how their online 'photowork' related to self-expression and social functioning. we contribute design considerations for developing tools to support photographic expression in social media use, and methodological insights about design-led inquiry for understanding transitional experiences.",11
MABLE: Mediating Young Children's Smart Media Usage with Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656581,"there has been a growing concern over the huge increase in use of smart media by young children. this study explores the possibility of using augmented-reality(ar) for regulat-ing preschoolers' media usage behavior. with mable (mobile application for behavioral learning and education), parents can provide ar-assisted feedback by changing facial expressions and sound effects. when overlaying a smart media, which has mable running, in front of a qr marker on a puppet, a facial expression is displayed on top of the puppet's face. a two-week long experiment with 36 parent-child pairs showed that compared to using just the puppet, using mable showed higher amount of engage-ment among preschoolers. for the effectiveness of parental mediation in terms of self-control, our data showed mixed results. mable had positive effects in that the amount of rule-compliance increased and problematic behaviors de-creased, whereas the level of behavioral dependency on smart media was not influenced.",12
How Relevant are Incidental Power Poses for HCI?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656582,"the concept of power pose originates from a psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. while multiple replication attempts of the 2010 study failed, the follow-up experiments on incidental postures have so far not been replicated. as ui design in hci can incidentally lead to expansive body postures, we attempted two conceptual replications: we first asked 44 participants to tap areas on a wall-sized display and measured their self-reported sense of power; we then asked 80 participants to play a game on a large touch-screen and measured risk-taking. based on bayesian analyses we find that incidental power poses had little to no effect on our measures but could cause physical discomfort. we conclude by discussing our findings in the context of theory-driven research in hci.",13
Designing and Evaluating mHealth Interventions for Vulnerable Populations: A Systematic Review,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656583,"diverse disciplines, including human-computer interaction have explored how mobile health (mhealth) applications can transform healthcare and health promotion. increasingly, research has explored how mhealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within vulnerable populations-groups that disproportionately experience barriers to wellness. we conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mhealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-ses) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. our findings highlight that the diversity within low-ses and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. we further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mhealth intervention adoption. our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations.",14
The Illusion of Control: Placebo Effects of Control Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656584,"algorithmic prioritization is a growing focus for social media users. control settings are one way for users to adjust the prioritization of their news feeds, but they prioritize feed content in a way that can be difficult to judge objectively. in this work, we study how users engage with difficult-to-validate controls. via two paired studies using an experimental system -- one interview and one online study -- we found that control settings functioned as placebos. viewers felt more satisfied with their feed when controls were present, whether they worked or not. we also examine how people engage in sensemaking around control settings, finding that users often take responsibility for violated expectations -- for both real and randomly functioning controls. finally, we studied how users controlled their social media feeds in the wild. the use of existing social media controls had little impact on user's satisfaction with the feed; instead, users often turned to improvised solutions, like scrolling quickly, to see what they want.",15
Easy Return: An App for Indoor Backtracking Assistance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656595,"we present a system that, implemented as an iphone app controllable from an apple watch, can help a blind person backtrack a route taken in a building. this system requires no maps of the building or environment modifications. while traversing a path from a starting location to a destination, the system builds and records a path representation in terms of a sequence of turns and of step counts between turns. if the user wants to backtrack the same path, the system can provide assistance by tracking the user's location in the recorded path, and producing directional information in speech form about the next turns and step counts to follow. the system was tested with six blind participants in a controlled indoor experiment.",16
Point-and-Shake: Selecting from Levitating Object Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656596,"acoustic levitation enables a radical new type of human-computer interface composed of small levitating objects. for the first time, we investigate the selection of such objects, an important part of interaction with a levitating object display. we present point-and-shake, a mid-air pointing interaction for selecting levitating objects, with feedback given through object movement. we describe the implementation of this technique and present two user studies that evaluate it. the first study found that users could accurately (96%) and quickly (4.1s) select objects by pointing at them. the second study found that users were able to accurately (95%) and quickly (3s) select occluded objects. these results show that point-and-shake is an effective way of initiating interaction with levitating object displays.",17
When David Meets Goliath: Combining Smartwatches with a Large Vertical Display for Visual Data Exploration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656597,"we explore the combination of smartwatches and a large interactive display to support visual data analysis. these two extremes of interactive surfaces are increasingly popular, but feature different characteristics-display and input modalities, personal/public use, performance, and portability. in this paper, we first identify possible roles for both devices and the interplay between them through an example scenario. we then propose a conceptual framework to enable analysts to explore data items, track interaction histories, and alter visualization configurations through mechanisms using both devices in combination. we validate an implementation of our framework through a formative evaluation and a user study. the results show that this device combination, compared to just a large display, allows users to develop complex insights more fluidly by leveraging the roles of the two devices. finally, we report on the interaction patterns and interplay between the devices for visual exploration as observed during our study.",18
SteeringWheel: A Locality-Preserving Magnification Interface for Low Vision Web Browsing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656598,"low-vision users struggle to browse the web with screen magnifiers. firstly, magnifiers occlude significant portions of the webpage, thereby making it cumbersome to get the webpage overview and quickly locate the desired content. further, magnification causes loss of spatial locality and visual cues that commonly define semantic relationships in the page; reconstructing semantic relationships exclusively from narrow views dramatically increases the cognitive burden on the users. secondly, low-vision users have widely varying needs requiring a range of interface customizations for different page sections; dynamic customization in extant magnifiers is disruptive to users' browsing. we present steeringwheel, a magnification interface that leverages content semantics to preserve local context. in combination with a physical dial, supporting simple rotate and press gestures, users can quickly navigate different webpage sections, easily locate desired content, get a quick overview, and seamlessly customize the interface. a user study with 15 low-vision participants showed that their web-browsing efficiency improved by at least 20 percent with steeringwheel compared to extant screen magnifiers.",19
Extending Keyboard Shortcuts with Arm and Wrist Rotation Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656599,"we propose and evaluate a novel interaction technique to enhance physical keyboard shortcuts with arm and wrist rotation gestures, performed during keypresses: rolling the wrist, rotating the arm/wrist, and lifting it. this extends the set of shortcuts from key combinations (e.g. ctrl + v) to combinations of key(s) and gesture (e.g. v + roll left) and enables continuous control. we implement this approach for isolated single keypresses, using inertial sensors of a smartwatch. we investigate key aspects in three studies: 1) rotation flexibility per keystroke finger, 2) rotation control, and 3) user-defined gesture shortcuts. as a use case, we employ our technique in a painting application and assess user experience. overall, results show that arm and wrist rotations during keystrokes can be used for interaction, yet challenges remain for integration into practical applications. we discuss recommendations for applications and ideas for future research.",20
IntroAssist: A Tool to Support Writing Introductory Help Requests,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656590,"writing introductory help requests is a key part of develop-ing new professional connections, such as through email and other online messaging systems. this paper presents the design and an experimental evaluation of introassist-a web-based tool that leverages cognitive apprenticeship in-structional methods to support writing introductory help requests through an expert-informed checklist, tagged peer examples, self-tagging, and suggested word limit. in a study of introassist with novice entrepreneurs, we find that 1) expert raters consider help requests written with the tool as more effective, 2) participants are able to perform introduc-tory help seeking skills after the tool is removed, and 3) participants report being more likely to send help requests written with the tool. we present implications for the de-velopment of systems that support the initiation of profes-sional relationships.",21
Surprise Me If You Can: Serendipity in Health Information,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656591,"our natural tendency to be curious is increasingly important now that we are exposed to vast amounts of information. we often cope with this overload by focusing on the familiar: information that matches our expectations. in this paper we present a framework for interactive serendipitous information discovery based on a computational model of surprise. this framework delivers information that users were not actively looking for, but which will be valuable to their unexpressed needs. we hypothesize that users will be surprised when presented with information that violates the expectations predicted by our model of them. this surprise model is balanced by a value component which ensures that the information is relevant to the user. within this framework we have implemented two surprise models, one based on association mining and the other on topic modeling approaches. we evaluate these two models with thirty users in the context of online health news recommendation. positive user feedback was obtained for both of the computational models of surprise compared to a baseline random method. this research contributes to the understanding of serendipity and how to ""engineer"" serendipity that is favored by users.",22
Awe the Audience: How the Narrative Trajectories Affect Audience Perception in Public Speaking,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656592,"telling a great story often involves a deliberate alteration of emotions. in this paper, we objectively measure and analyze the narrative trajectories of stories in public speaking and their impact on subjective ratings. we conduct the analysis using the transcripts of over 2000 ted talks and estimate potential audience response using over 5 million spontaneous annotations from the viewers. we use ibm watson tone analyzer to extract sentence-wise emotion, language, and social scores. our study indicates that it is possible to predict (with auc as high as 0.88) the subjective ratings of the audience by analyzing the narrative trajectories. additionally, we find that some trajectories (for example, a flat trajectory of joy) correlate well with some specific ratings (e.g. ""longwinded') assigned by the viewers. such an association could be useful in forecasting audience responses using objective analysis.",23
Introducing Transient Gestures to Improve Pan and Zoom on Touch Surfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656593,"despite the ubiquity of touch-based input and the availability of increasingly computationally powerful touchscreen devices, there has been comparatively little work on enhancing basic canonical gestures such as swipe-to-pan and pinch-to-zoom. in this paper, we introduce transient pan and zoom, i.e. pan and zoom manipulation gestures that temporarily alter the view and can be rapidly undone. leveraging typical touchscreen support for additional contact points, we design our transient gestures such that they co-exist with traditional pan and zoom interaction. we show that our transient pan-and-zoom reduces repetition in multi-level navigation and facilitates rapid movement between document states. we conclude with a discussion of user feedback, and directions for future research.",24
MirrorMirror: A Mobile Application to Improve Speechreading Acquisition,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656594,"many people around the world have difficulties in day-to-day conversation due to hearing loss. hearing aids often fail to offer enough benefits and have low adoption rates. however, people with hearing loss find that speechreading can improve their understanding during conversation, but speechreading is a challenging skill to learn. speechreading classes can improve acquisition, however there are a limited number of classes available and students can only practice effectively when attending class. to address this, we conducted a postal survey with 59 speechreading students to understand students' perspectives on practicing. using our findings, we developed an android application called mirrormirror - a new speechreading acquisition tool (sat) that allows students to practice their speechreading by recording and watching videos of people they frequently speak with. we evaluated mirrormirror through three case studies with speechreading students and found that they could effectively target their speechreading practice on people, words and situations they encounter during daily conversations.",25
Hybrid-Brailler: Combining Physical and Gestural Interaction for Mobile Braille Input and Editing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656505,"braille input enables fast nonvisual entry speeds on mobile touchscreen devices. yet, the lack of tactile cues commonly results in typing errors, which are hard to correct. we propose hybrid-brailler, an input solution that combines physical and gestural interaction to provide fast and accurate braille input. we use the back of the device for physical chorded input while freeing the touchscreen for gestural interaction. gestures are used in editing operations, such as caret movement, text selection, and clipboard control, enhancing the overall text entry experience. we conducted two user studies to assess both input and editing performance. results show that hybrid-brailler supports fast entry rates as its virtual counterpart, while significantly increasing input accuracy. regarding editing performance, when compared with the mainstream technique, hybrid-brailler shows performance benefits of 21% in speed and increased editing accuracy. we finish with lessons learned for designing future nonvisual input and editing techniques.",26
Flexible and Mindful Self-Tracking: Design Implications from Paper Bullet Journals,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656506,"digital self-tracking technologies offer many potential benefits over self-tracking with paper notebooks. however, they are often too rigid to support people's practical and emotional needs in everyday settings. to inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we examine bullet journaling: an analogue and customisable approach for logging and reflecting on everyday life. analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a self-tracking culture of sharing and learning. we outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice.",27
Predicting Human Performance in Vertical Menu Selection Using Deep Learning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656507,"predicting human performance in interaction tasks allows designers or developers to understand the expected performance of a target interface without actually testing it with real users. in this work, we present a deep neural net to model and predict human performance in performing a sequence of ui tasks. in particular, we focus on a dominant class of tasks, i.e., target selection from a vertical list or menu. we experimented with our deep neural net using a public dataset collected from a desktop laboratory environment and a dataset collected from hundreds of touchscreen smartphone users via crowdsourcing. our model significantly outperformed previous methods on these datasets. importantly, our method, as a deep model, can easily incorporate additional ui attributes such as visual appearance and content semantics without changing model architectures. by understanding about how a deep learning model learns from human behaviors, our approach can be seen as a vehicle to discover new patterns about human behaviors to advance analytical modeling.",28
Customizing Hybrid Products,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656508,"we explore how the convergence of the digital and physical into hybrid products leads to new possibilities for customization. we report on a technology probe, a hybrid advent calendar with both paper form and digital layers of content, both of which were designed to be customizable. we reveal how over two hundred active users adapted its physical and digital aspects in various ways, some anticipated and familiar, but others surprising. this leads us to contribute concepts to help understand and design for hybrid customization -- the idea of broad customization spanning physical and digital; end-to-end customization by different stakeholders along the value chain for a product; and the combination of these into customization maps.",29
Fingers' Range and Comfortable Area for One-Handed Smartphone Interaction Beyond the Touchscreen,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656509,"previous research and recent smartphone development presented a wide range of input controls beyond the touchscreen. fingerprint scanners, silent switches, and back-of-device (bod) touch panels offer additional ways to perform input. however, with the increasing amount of input controls on the device, unintentional input or limited reachability can hinder interaction. in a one-handed scenario, we conducted a study to investigate the areas that can be reached without losing grip stability (comfortable area), and with stretched fingers (maximum range) using four different phone sizes. we describe the characteristics of the comfortable area and maximum range for different phone sizes and derive four design implications for the placement of input controls to support one-handed bod and edge interaction. amongst others, we show that the index and middle finger are the most suited fingers for bod interaction and that the grip shifts towards the top edge with increasing phone sizes.",30
Exploration and Explanation in Computational Notebooks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656500,"computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",31
Multi-Touch Skin: A Thin and Flexible Multi-Touch Sensor for On-Skin Input,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656501,"skin-based touch input opens up new opportunities for direct, subtle, and expressive interaction. however, existing skin-worn sensors are restricted to single-touch input and limited by a low resolution. we present the first skin overlay that can capture high-resolution multi-touch input. our main contributions are: 1) based on an exploration of functional materials, we present a fabrication approach for printing thin and flexible multi-touch sensors for on-skin interactions. 2) we present the first non-rectangular multi-touch sensor overlay for use on skin and introduce a design tool that generates such sensors in custom shapes and sizes. 3) to validate the feasibility and versatility of our approach, we present four application examples and empirical results from two technical evaluations. they confirm that the sensor achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio on the body under various grounding conditions and has a high spatial accuracy even when subjected to strong deformations.",32
Improving Comprehension of Measurements Using Concrete Re-expression Strategies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656502,"it can be difficult to understand physical measurements (e.g., 28 lb, 600 gallons) that appear in news stories, data reports, and other documents. we develop tools that automatically re-express unfamiliar measurements using the measurements of familiar objects. our work makes three contributions: (1) we identify effectiveness criteria for objects used in concrete measurement re-expressions; (2) we operationalize these criteria in a scalable method for mining a large dataset of concrete familiar objects with their physical dimensions from amazon and wikipedia; and (3) we develop automated concrete re-expression tools that implement three common re-expression strategies (adding familiar context, reunitization and proportional analogy) as energy minimization algorithms. crowdsourced evaluations of our tools indicate that people find news articles with re-expressions more helpful and re- expressions help them to better estimate new measurements.",33
Understanding the Needs of Searchers with Dyslexia,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656503,"as many as 20% of english speakers have dyslexia, a language disability that impacts reading and spelling. web search is an important modern literacy skill, yet the accessibility of this language-centric endeavor to people with dyslexia is largely unexplored. we interviewed ten adults with dyslexia and conducted an online survey with 81 dyslexic and 80 non-dyslexic adults, in which participants described challenges they face in various stages of web search (query formulation, search result triage, and information extraction). we also report the findings of an online study in which 174 adults with dyslexia and 172 without dyslexia rated the readability and relevance of sets of search query results. our findings demonstrate differences in behaviors and preferences between dyslexic and non-dyslexic searchers, and indicate that factoring readability into search engine rankings and/or interfaces may benefit both dyslexic and non-dyslexic users.",34
Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656504,"toolkit research plays an important role in the field of hci, as it can heavily influence both the design and implementation of interactive systems. for publication, the hci community typically expects toolkit research to include an evaluation component. the problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what 'evaluating' a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. to address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. from our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. we identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. we offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy.",35
TopoText: Context-Preserving Text Data Exploration Across Multiple Spatial Scales,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656515,"topotext is a context-preserving technique for visualizing text data for multi-scale spatial aggregates to gain insight into spatial phenomena. conventional exploration requires users to navigate across multiple scales but only presents the information related to the current scale. this limitation potentially adds more steps of interaction and cognitive overload to the users. topotext renders multi-scale aggregates into a single visual display combining novel text-based encoding and layout methods that draw labels along the boundary or filled within the aggregates. the text itself not only summarizes the semantics at each individual scale, but also indicates the spatial coverage of the aggregates and their underlying hierarchical relationships. we validate topotext with both a user study as well as several application examples.",36
Design Patterns for Data Comics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656516,"data comics for data-driven storytelling are inspired by the visual language of comics and aim to communicate insights in data through visualizations. while comics are widely known, few examples of data comics exist and there has not been any structured analysis nor guidance for their creation. we introduce data-comic design-patterns, each describing a set of panels with a specific narrative purpose, that allow for rapid storyboarding of data comics while showcasing their expressive potential. our patterns are derived from i) analyzing common patterns in infographics, datavideos, and existing data comics, ii) our experiences creating data comics for different scenarios. our patterns demonstrate how data comics allow an author to combine the best of both worlds: spatial layout and overview from infographics as well as linearity and narration from videos and presentations.",37
"Practices and Technology Needs of a Network of Farmers in Tharaka Nithi, Kenya",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656517,"farmers in rural areas of kenya generally rely on traditional agricultural practices inherited from past generations. however, population increases and climate changes have put pressure on resources such as land and water. these resource pressures have created a need to broaden and expand farming practices. we conducted an exploratory study with farmers in tharaka nithi, kenya to explore their practices, if and how they used ict, and how the technologies used might be designed to aid their practices, if at all. overall, our results show that farmers desired more knowledge to enable them apply ict interventions in ways that improved yields. farmers were also interested in accessing information on soil fertility, water predictability and market opportunities. these findings suggest opportunities for technology design to support farming practices among rural communities in rural settings. we also articulate social challenges that designers will face when thinking about coming up with such solutions.",38
Design for Collaborative Survival: An Inquiry into Human-Fungi Relationships,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656518,"in response to recent calls for hci to address ongoing environmental crises and existential threats, this paper introduces the concept of collaborative survival and examines how it shapes the design of interactive artifacts. collaborative survival describes how our (human) ability to persist as a species is deeply entangled with and dependent upon the health of a multitude of other species. we explore collaborative survival within the context of designing tools for mushroom foraging and reflect on how interactive products can open new pathways for noticing and joining-with these entanglements towards preferable futures. in addition to highlighting three tactics-engagement, attunement and expansion-that can guide designs towards multispecies flourishing, our prototypes illustrate the potential for wearable technology to extend the body into the environment.",39
“An Odd Kind of Pleasure”: Differentiating Emotional Challenge in Digital Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656519,"recent work introduced the notion of emotional challenge as a means to afford more unique and diverse gaming experiences. however, players' experience of emotional challenge has received little empirical attention. it remains unclear whether players enjoy it and what exactly constitutes the challenge thereof. we surveyed 171 players about a challenging or an emotionally challenging experience, and analyzed their responses with regards to what made the experience challenging, their emotional response, and the relation to core player experience constructs. we found that emotional challenge manifested itself in different ways, by confronting players with difficult themes or decisions, as well as having them deal with intense emotions. in contrast to more'conventional' challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions and was appreciated significantly more by players. our findings showcase the appeal of uncomfortable gaming experiences, and extend current conceptualizations of challenge in games.",40
Eyes-Free Target Acquisition in Interaction Space around the Body for Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656510,"eyes-free target acquisition is a basic and important human ability to interact with the surrounding physical world, relying on the sense of space and proprioception. in this research, we leverage this ability to improve interaction in virtual reality (vr), by allowing users to acquire a virtual object without looking at it. we expect this eyes-free approach can effectively reduce head movements and focus changes, so as to speed up the interaction and alleviate fatigue and vr sickness. we conduct three lab studies to progressively investigate the feasibility and usability of eyes-free target acquisition in vr. results show that, compared with the eyes-engaged manner, the eyes-free approach is significantly faster, provides satisfying accuracy, and introduces less fatigue and sickness; most participants (13/16) prefer this approach. we also measure the accuracy of motion control and evaluate subjective experience of users when acquiring targets at different locations around the body. based on the results, we make suggestions on designing appropriate target layout and discuss several design issues for eyes-free target acquisition in vr.",41
Change Blindness in Proximity-Aware Mobile Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656511,"interface designs on both small and large displays can encourage people to alter their physical distance to the display. mobile devices support this form of interaction naturally, as the user can move the device closer or further away as needed. the current generation of mobile devices can employ computer vision, depth sensing and other inference methods to determine the distance between the user and the display. once this distance is known, a system can adapt the rendering of display content accordingly and enable proximity-aware mobile interfaces. the dominant method of exploiting proximity-aware interfaces is to remove or superimpose visual information. in this paper, we investigate change blindness in such interfaces. we present the results of two experiments. in our first experiment we show that a proximity-aware mobile interface results in significantly more change blindness errors than a non-moving interface. the absolute difference in error rates was 13.7%. in our second experiment we show that within a proximity-aware mobile interface, gradual changes induce significantly more change blindness errors than instant changes---confirming expected change blindness behavior. based on our results we discuss the implications of either exploiting change blindness effects or mitigating them when designing mobile proximity-aware interfaces.",42
Rethinking Thinking Aloud: A Comparison of Three Think-Aloud Protocols,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656512,"this paper presents the results of a study that compared three think-aloud methods: concurrent think-aloud, retrospective think-aloud, and a hybrid method. the three methods were compared through an evaluation of a library website, which involved four points of comparison: task performance, participants' experiences, usability problems discovered, and the cost of employing the methods. the results revealed that the concurrent method outperformed both the retrospective and the hybrid methods in facilitating successful usability testing. it detected higher numbers of usability problems than the retrospective method, and produced output comparable to that of the hybrid method. the method received average to positive ratings from its users, and no reactivity was observed. lastly, this method required much less time on the evaluator's part than did the other two methods, which involved double the testing and analysis time.",43
"Reading on Smart Glasses: The Effect of Text Position, Presentation Type and Walking",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656513,"smart glasses are increasingly being used in professional contexts. having key applications such as short messaging and newsreader, they enable continuous access to textual information. in particular, smart glasses allow reading while performing other activities as they do not occlude the user's world view. for efficient reading, it is necessary to understand how a text should be presented on them. we, therefore, conducted a study with 24 participants using a microsoft hololens to investigate how to display text on smart glasses while walking and sitting. we compared text presentation in the top-right, center, and bottom-center positions with rapid serial visual presentation (rsvp) and line-by-line scrolling. we found that text displayed in the top-right of smart glasses increases subjective workload and reduces comprehension. rsvp yields higher comprehension while sitting. conversely, reading with scrolling yields higher comprehension while walking. insights from our study inform the design of reading interfaces for smart glasses.",44
Mini-Me: An Adaptive Avatar for Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656514,"we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",45
Viewer Experience of Obscuring Scene Elements in Photos to Enhance Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656525,"with the rise of digital photography and social networking, people are sharing personal photos online at an unprecedented rate. in addition to their main subject matter, photographs often capture various incidental information that could harm people's privacy. while blurring and other image filters may help obscure private content, they also often affect the utility and aesthetics of the photos, which is important since images shared in social media are mainly for human consumption. existing studies of privacy-enhancing image filters either primarily focus on obscuring faces, or do not systematically study how filters affect image utility. to understand the trade-offs when obscuring various sensitive aspects of images, we study eleven filters applied to obfuscate twenty different objects and attributes, and evaluate how effectively they protect privacy and preserve image quality for human viewers.",46
Navigating the Job Search as a Low-Resourced Job Seeker,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656526,"the internet is providing increasing access to information about employment opportunities, but not everyone can leverage it effectively. research suggests that job seekers with limited access to internet technologies are being left behind, while those with limited social resources are expected to rely on the internet even more. in this work, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 low-resourced job seekers in a metropolitan area in the midwestern usa to understand how social and digital resources support their efforts to find work. we find that online resources support job seekers in finding relevant jobs via search, but do not help them identify opportunities to improve their job search process or increase their chances of securing employment. we recommend that systems aiming to support low-resourced job seekers design for deeper engagement with their users across the job search process, to help users recognize ways to improve on their existing practices.",47
The Value of Empty Space for Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656527,"we present a study on a group of people who, upon adopting a new lifestyle movement, have discovered and constructed alternative aspects of space. drawing on 23 interviews with minimalists and participant observations of their meetup meetings, we highlight the central role of empty space in their lives at home. our findings show how empty space for minimalists emerge as a new, hitherto unknown space in the home and the ways minimalists seek to create, maintain, and stay sensitive to these empty spaces. empty spaces for minimalists signify their achievements, exudes aesthetic appeal, and provide a sanctuary away from city life. we propose new opportunities for design based on our findings of empty space. we suggest that design should consider supporting the practices and values that revolve around the absence of artifacts.",48
Disorder or Driver?: The Effects of Nomophobia on Work-Related Outcomes in Organizations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656528,"nomophobia, which refers to discomfort or anxiety caused by being unable to use one's smartphone, has become prevalent among smartphone users. however, the influence of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes remains unclear. drawing on the job demands-resources theory, this study develops a model that explores the interplay between employees' nomophobia, work engagement, emotional exhaustion, work interruption, and job productivity. the proposed model was tested using data collected from 187 employees in one organization. the results demonstrate that some employees with high levels of nomophobia feel more engaged with their work and more productive, yet others tend to be emotionally exhausted and feel they are less productive. by illuminating the dual effects of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes, this study extends our understanding of how smartphone use positively and negatively affects employees in the workplace. the notion of nomophobia in the workplace is discussed, along with new directions for research.",49
"My Telepresence, My Culture?: An Intercultural Investigation of Telepresence Robot Operators' Interpersonal Distance Behaviors",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656529,"interpersonal distance behaviors can vary significantly across countries and impact human social interaction. do these cross-cultural differences play out when one of the interaction partners participates through a teleoperated robot? emerging research shows that when being approached by a robot, people tend to hold similar cultural preferences as they would for an approaching human. however, no work yet has investigated this question from a robot teleoperator's perspective. toward answering this, we conducted an online study (n = 774) using a novel simulation paradigm across two countries (u.s. and india). results show that in the role of a telepresence robot operator, participants exhibited cross-cultural differences in interpersonal distance behavior in line with human-human proxemic research, indicating that culture-specific distance behavior can manifest in the way a robot operator controls a robot. we discuss implications for designers who seek to automate path planning and navigation for teleoperated robots.",50
"Privacy Lies: Understanding How, When, and Why People Lie to Protect Their Privacy in Multiple Online Contexts",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656520,"in this paper, we study online privacy lies: lies primarily aimed at protecting privacy. going beyond privacy lenses that focus on privacy concerns or cost/benefit analyses, we explore how contextual factors, motivations, and individual-level characteristics affect lying behavior through a 356-person survey. we find that statistical models to predict privacy lies that include attitudes about lying, use of other privacy-protective behaviors (ppbs), and perceived control over information improve on models based solely on self-expressed privacy concerns. based on a thematic analysis of open-ended responses, we find that the decision to tell privacy lies stems from a range of concerns, serves multiple privacy goals, and is influenced by the context of the interaction and attitudes about the morality and necessity of lying. together, our results point to the need for conceptualizations of privacy lies-and ppbs more broadly-that account for multiple goals, perceived control over data, contextual factors, and attitudes about ppbs.",51
"""We Are the Product"": Public Reactions to Online Data Sharing and Privacy Controversies in the Media",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656521,"as online platforms increasingly collect large amounts of data about their users, there has been growing public concern about privacy around issues such as data sharing. controversies around practices perceived as surprising or even unethical often highlight patterns of privacy attitudes when they spark conversation in the media. this paper examines public reaction ""in the wild"" to two data sharing controversies that were the focus of media attention-regarding the social media and communication services facebook and whatsapp, as well as the email service unroll.me. these controversies instigated discussion of data privacy and ethics, accessibility of website policies, notions of responsibility for privacy, cost-benefit analyses, and strategies for privacy management such as non-use. an analysis of reactions and interactions captured by comments on news articles not only reveals information about pervasive privacy attitudes, but also suggests communication and design strategies that could benefit both platforms and users.",52
FaceDisplay: Towards Asymmetric Multi-User Interaction for Nomadic Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656522,"mobile vr hmds enable scenarios where they are being used in public, excluding all the people in the surrounding (non-hmd users) and reducing them to be sole bystanders. we present facedisplay, a modified vr hmd consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. people in the surrounding can perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the hmd user via touch or gestures. to further explore the design space of facedisplay, we implemented three applications (fruitslicer, spaceface and conductor) each presenting different sets of aspects of the asymmetric co-located interaction (e.g. gestures vs touch). we conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications and showing a high level of enjoyment and social interaction with and without an hmd. based on the findings we derive design considerations for asymmetric co-located vr applications and argue that vr hmds are currently designed having only the hmd user in mind but should also include non-hmd users.",53
Interactive Guidance Techniques for Improving Creative Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656523,"good feedback is critical to creativity and learning, yet rare. many people do not know how to actually provide effective feedback. there is increasing demand for quality feedback -- and thus feedback givers -- in learning and professional settings. this paper contributes empirical evidence that two interactive techniques -- reusable suggestions and adaptive guidance -- can improve feedback on creative work. we present these techniques embodied in the critiquekit system to help reviewers give specific, actionable, and justified feedback. two real-world deployment studies and two controlled experiments with critiquekit found that adaptively-presented suggestions improve the quality of feedback from novice reviewers. reviewers also reported that suggestions and guidance helped them describe their thoughts and reminded them to provide effective feedback.",54
Environmental Factors in Indoor Navigation Based on Real-World Trajectories of Blind Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656524,"indoor localization technologies can enhance quality of life for blind people by enabling them to independently explore and navigate indoor environments. researchers typically evaluate their systems in terms of localization accuracy and user behavior along planned routes. we propose two measures of path-following behavior: deviation from optimal route and trajectory variability. through regression analysis of real-world trajectories from blind users, we identify relationships between a) these measures and b) elements of the environment, route characteristics, localization error, and instructional cues that users receive. our results provide insights into path-following behavior for turn-by-turn indoor navigation and have implications for the design of future interactions. moreover, our findings highlight the importance of reporting these environmental factors and route properties in similar studies. we present automated and scalable methods for their calculation and to encourage their reporting for better interpretation and comparison of results across future studies.",55
BSpeak: An Accessible Voice-based Crowdsourcing Marketplace for Low-Income Blind People,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656535,"bspeak is an accessible crowdsourcing marketplace that enables blind people in developing regions to earn money by transcribing audio files through speech. we examine accessibility and usability barriers that 15 first-time users, who are low-income and blind, experienced while completing transcription tasks on bspeak and mechanical turk (mturk). our mixed-methods analysis revealed severe accessibility barriers in mturk due to the absence of landmarks, unlabeled ui elements, and improper use of html headings. compared to mturk, participants found bspeak significantly more accessible and usable, and completed tasks with higher accuracy in lesser time due to its voice-based implementation. in a two-week field deployment of bspeak in india, 24 low-income blind users earned rupee 7,310 by completing over 16,000 transcription tasks to yield transcriptions with 87% accuracy. through our analysis of bspeak's strengths and weaknesses, we provide recommendations for designing crowdsourcing marketplaces for low-income blind people in resource-constrained settings.",56
Understanding Chatbot-mediated Task Management,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656536,"effective task management is essential to successful team collaboration. while the past decade has seen considerable innovation in systems that track and manage group tasks, these innovations have typically been outside of the principal communication channels: email, instant messenger, and group chat. teams formulate, discuss, refine, assign, and track the progress of their collaborative tasks over electronic communication channels, yet they must leave these channels to update their task-tracking tools, creating a source of friction and inefficiency. to address this problem, we explore how bots might be used to mediate task management for individuals and teams. we deploy a prototype bot to eight different teams of information workers to help them create, assign, and keep track of tasks, all within their main communication channel. we derived seven insights for the design of future bots for coordinating work.",57
Rich Representations of Visual Content for Screen Reader Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656537,"alt text (short for ""alternative text"") is descriptive text associated with an image in html and other document formats. screen reader technologies speak the alt text aloud to people who are visually impaired. introduced with html 2.0 in 1995, the alt attribute has not evolved despite significant changes in technology over the past two decades. in light of the expanding volume, purpose, and importance of digital imagery, we reflect on how alt text could be supplemented to offer a richer experience of visual content to screen reader users. our contributions include articulating the design space of representations of visual content for screen reader users, prototypes illustrating several points within this design space, and evaluations of several of these new image representations with people who are blind. we close by discussing the implications of our taxonomy, prototypes, and user study findings.",58

Grafter: Remixing 3D-Printed Machines,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656531,"creating new 3d printed objects by recombining models found in hobbyist repositories has been referred to as ""re-mixing"". in this paper, we explore how to best support users in remixing a specific class of 3d printed objects, namely those that perform mechanical functions. in our survey, we found that makers remix such machines by manually extracting parts from one parent model and combine it with parts from a different parent model. this approach often puts axles made by one maker into bearings made by another maker or combines a gear by one maker with a gear by a different maker. this approach is problem-atic, however, as parts from different makers tend to fit poorly, which results in long series of tweaks and test-prints until all parts finally work together. we address this with our interactive system grafter. grafter does two things. first, grafter largely automates the process of extracting and recombining mechanical elements from 3d printed machines. second, it enforces a more efficient approach to reuse: it prevents users from extracting indi-vidual parts, but instead affords extracting groups of me-chanical elements that already work together, such as axles and their bearings or pairs of gears. we call this mecha-nism-based remixing. in a final user study, all models that participants had remixed using grafter could be 3d printed without further tweaking and worked immediately.",62
Depth Conflict Reduction for Stereo VR Video Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656532,"applications for viewing and editing 360° video often render user interface (ui) elements on top of the video. for stereoscopic video, in which the perceived depth varies over the image, the perceived depth of the video can conflict with that of the ui elements, creating discomfort and making it hard to shift focus. to address this problem, we explore two new techniques that adjust the ui rendering based on the video content. the first technique dynamically adjusts the perceived depth of the ui to avoid depth conflict, and the second blurs the video in a halo around the ui. we conduct a user study to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in two stereoscopic vr video tasks: video watching with subtitles, and video search.",63
"From Pulse Trains to ""Coloring with Vibrations"": Motion Mappings for Mid-Air Haptic Textures",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656533,"can we experience haptic textures in mid-air? typically, the experience of texture is caused by vibration of the fingertip as it moves over the surface of an object. this object's surface also guides the finger's movement, creating an implicit motion-to-vibration mapping. if we wish to simulate a texture in mid-air, such guidance does not exist, making the choice of motion-to-vibration mapping non-obvious. we evaluate the experience of moving a pointer with four different motion-to vibration mappings in an interview study. we found that some mappings lead to a perception shift, transforming the experience. when this occurs, the pointer is no longer perceived as vibrating, interactions become more pleasurable, and users have an increased experience of agency and control. we discuss how to leverage this in the design of haptic interfaces.",64
Collaborative Dynamic Queries: Supporting Distributed Small Group Decision-making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656534,"communication is critical in small group decision-making processes during which each member must be able to express preferences to reach consensus. finding consensus can be difficult when each member in a group has a perspective that potentially conflicts with those of others. to support groups attempting to harmonize diverse preferences, we propose collaborative dynamic queries (c-dq), a ui component that enables a group to filter queries over decision criteria while being aware of others' preferences. to understand how c-dq affects a group's behavior and perception in the decision-making process, we conducted 2 studies with groups who were prompted to make decisions together on mobile devices in a dispersed and synchronous situation. in study 1, we found showing group preferences with c-dq helped groups to communicate more efficiently and effectively. in study 2, we found filtering candidates based on each member's own filter range further improved a groups' communication efficiency and effectiveness.",65
Crowdsourcing Rural Network Maintenance and Repair via Network Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656545,"repair and maintenance requirements limit the successful operation of rural infrastructure. current best practices are centralized management, which requires travel from urban areas and is prohibitively expensive, or intensively training community members, which limits scaling. we explore an alternative model: crowdsourcing repair from the community. leveraging a community cellular network in the remote philippines, we sent sms to all active network subscribers (n = 63) requesting technical support. from the pool of physical respondents, we explored their ability to repair through mock failures and conducted semi-structured interviews about their experiences with repair. we learned that community members would be eager to practice repair if allowed, would network to recruit more expertise, and seemingly have the collective capacity to resolve some common failures. they are most successful when repairs map directly to their lived experiences. we suggest infrastructure design considerations that could make repairs more tractable and argue for an inclusive approach.",66
Interactive Interior and Proxemics Thresholds: Empowering Participants in Sensitive Conversations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656546,"the position and workings of interactive interior elements matter greatly on the relations people may enact. this paper reports on the conception and evaluation of an interactive table and its interior effects designed to support sensitive consultations between healthcare personnel, patients and relatives as they happen during treatment of cancer diseases in a hospital department of oncology. the interior design includes the physical shape of artefact, its digital functionality and how the seating around it is to take place. the design of the table is substantiated through observations of current practice, framing of the design challenge, conceptualization, and exploring form giving alternatives. through a set of evaluations in actual use settings it is argued how the design concept of the table as interactive interior points to how notions in interaction proxemics should be rearticulated. in particular, this paper argues how proxemics thresholds should be regarded as dynamic and relational.",67

What's at Stake: Characterizing Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656548,"one contributing factor to how people choose to use technology is their perceptions of associated risk. in order to explore this influence, we adapted a survey instrument from risk perception literature to assess mental models of users and technologists around risks of emerging, data-driven technologies (e.g., identity theft, personalized filter bubbles). we surveyed 175 individuals for comparative and individual assessments of risk, including characterizations using psychological factors. we report our observations around group differences (e.g., expert versus non-expert) in how people assess risk, and what factors may structure their conceptions of technological harm. our findings suggest that technologists see these risks as posing a bigger threat to society than do non-experts. moreover, across groups, participants did not see technological risks as voluntarily assumed. differences in how people characterize risk have implications for the future of design, decision-making, and public communications, which we discuss through a lens we call risk-sensitive design.",69
TaskCam: Designing and Testing an Open Tool for Cultural Probes Studies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656549,"taskcams are simple digital cameras intended to serve as a tool for cultural probe studies and made available by the interaction research studio via open-source distribution. in conjunction with an associated website, instructions and videos, they represent a novel strategy for disseminating and facilitating a research methodology. at the same time, they provide a myriad of options for customisation and modification, allowing researchers to adopt and adapt them to their needs. in the first part of this paper, the design team describes the rationale and design of the taskcams and the tactics developed to make them publicly available. in the second part, the story is taken up by designers from the everyday design studio, who assembled their own taskcams and customised them extensively for a cultural probe study they ran for an ongoing project. rather than discussing the results of their study, we focus on how their experiences reveal some of the issues both in producing and using open-source products such as these. these suggest the potential of taskcams to support design-led user studies more generally.",70
Making Problems in Design Research: The Case of Teen Shoplifters on Tumblr,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656540,"hci draws on a variety of traditions but recently there have been calls to consolidate contributions around the problems researchers set out to solve. however, with this comes the assumption that problems are tractable and certain, rather than constructed and framed by researchers. we take as a case study a tumblr community of teen shoplifters who post on how to steal from stores, discuss shoplifting as political resistance, and share jokes and stories about the practice. we construct three different ""problems"" and imagine studies that might result from applying different design approaches: design against crime; critical design and value sensitive design. through these studies we highlight how interpretations of the same data can lead to radically different design responses. we conclude by discussing problem making as a historically and politically contingent process that allow researchers to connect data and design according to certain moral and ethical principles.",71
Group vs Individual: Impact of TOUCH and TILT Cross-Device Interactions on Mixed-Focus Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656541,"cross-device environments (xdes) have been developed to support a multitude of collaborative activities. yet, little is known about how different cross-device interaction techniques impact group collaboration, including how their impact on independent and joint work that often occurs during group work. in this work, we explore the impact of two xde data browsing techniques: touch and tilt. through a mixed-methods study of a collaborative sensemaking task, we show that touch and tilt have distinct impacts on how groups accomplish, and shift between, independent and joint work. finally, we reflect on these findings and how they can more generally inform the design of xdes.",72
Back to Analogue: Self-Reporting for Parkinson's Disease,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656542,"we report the process used to create artefacts for self-reporting parkinson's disease symptoms. our premise was that a technology-based approach would provide participants with an effective, flexible, and resilient technique. after testing four prototypes using bluetooth, nfc, and a microcontroller we accomplished almost full compliance and high acceptance using a paper diary to track day-to-day fluctuations over 49 days. this diary is tailored to each patient's condition, does not require any handwriting, allows for implicit reminders, provides recording flexibility, and its answers can be encoded automatically. we share five design implications for future parkinson's self-reporting artefacts: reduce participant completion demand, design to offset the effect of tremor on input, enable implicit reminders, design for positive and negative consequences of increased awareness of symptoms, and consider the effects of handwritten notes in compliance, encoding burden, and data quality.",73
The Hide and Seek of Workspace: Towards Human-Centric Sustainable Architecture,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656543,"this contribution exemplifies how the study of space perception and its impact on space-use behavior can inform sustainable architecture. we describe our attempt to integrate the methods of user research in an architectural project that was focused on optimization of space usage. in an office building, two large office rooms were refurbished to provide desk-sharing opportunities through hot-desking. we studied the space-use behavior of 33 office workers over eight weeks in those two rooms as well as their occasional presence in ten other areas (cafeteria, atrium, meeting rooms, etc.). quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to understand the nature and nuances of space occupancy at the scope of the building and within the refurbished offices. while at the scope of building the patterns of movements between rooms were found to be related to the professional profile of the users, at the scope of office the occupancy patterns were influenced by the spatial design of workspaces. more precisely, certain visual attributes of a workspace, namely visual exposure and visual openness, could determine whether or not it was regularly used. in this paper, we describe our findings in detail and discuss their implications for sustainable building design.",74
"How Teens with Visual Impairments Take, Edit, and Share Photos on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656544,"we contribute a qualitative investigation of how teens with visual impairments (vip) access smartphone photography, from the time they take photos through editing and sharing them on social media. we observed that they largely want to engage with photos visually, similarly to their sighted peers, and have developed strategies around photo capture, editing, sharing, and consumption that attempt to mitigate usability limitations of current photography and social media apps. we demonstrate the need for more work examining how young people with low vision engage with smartphone photography and social media, as they are heavy users of such technologies and have challenges distinct from their totally blind counterparts. we conclude with design considerations to alleviate the usability barriers we uncovered and for making smartphone photography and social media more accessible and relevant for vips.",75
Attending to Slowness and Temporality with Olly and Slow Game: A Design Inquiry Into Supporting Longer-Term Relations with Everyday Computational Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656655,"slowness has emerged as a rich lens to frame hci investigations into supporting longer-term human-technology relations. yet, there is a need to further address how we design for slowness on conceptual and practical levels. drawing on the concepts of unawareness, intersections, and ensembles, we contribute an investigation into designing for slowness and temporality grounded in design practice through two cases: olly and slow game. we designed these artifacts over two and a half years with careful attention to how the set of concepts influenced key design decisions in terms of their form, materials, and computational qualities. our designer-researcher approach revealed that, when put into practice, the concepts helped generatively grapple with slowness and temporality, but are in need of further development to be mobilized for design. we critically reflect on insights emerging across our practice-based research to reflexively refine the concepts and better support future hci research and practice.",76
VirtualGrasp: Leveraging Experience of Interacting with Physical Objects to Facilitate Digital Object Retrieval,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656656,"we propose virtualgrasp, a novel gestural approach to retrieve virtual objects in virtual reality. using virtualgrasp, a user retrieves an object by performing a barehanded gesture as if grasping its physical counterpart. the object-gesture mapping under this metaphor is of high intuitiveness, which enables users to easily discover, remember the gestures to retrieve the objects. we conducted three user studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. progressively, we investigated the consensus of the object-gesture mapping across users, the expressivity of grasping gestures, and the learnability and performance of the approach. results showed that users achieved high agreement on the mapping, with an average agreement score [35] of 0.68 (sd=0.27). without exposure to the gestures, users successfully retrieved 76% objects with virtualgrasp. a week after learning the mapping, they could recall the gestures for 93% objects.",77
Harvesting Caregiving Knowledge: Design Considerations for Integrating Volunteer Input in Dementia Care,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656657,"improving volunteer performance leads to better caregiving in dementia care settings. however, caregiving knowledge systems have been focused on eliciting and sharing expert, primary caregiver knowledge, rather than volunteer-provided knowledge. through the use of an experience prototype, we explored the content of volunteer caregiver knowledge and identified ways in which such non-expert knowledge can be useful to dementia care. by using lay language, sharing information specific to the client and collaboratively finding strategies for interaction, volunteers were able to boost the effectiveness of future volunteers. therapists who reviewed the content affirmed the reliability of volunteer caregiver knowledge and placed value on its recency, variety and its ability to help bridge language and professional barriers. we discuss how future systems designed for eliciting and sharing volunteer caregiver knowledge can be used to promote better dementia care.",78

Pinpointing: Precise Head- and Eye-Based Target Selection for Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656659,"head and eye movement can be leveraged to improve the user's interaction repertoire for wearable displays. head movements are deliberate and accurate, and provide the current state-of-the-art pointing technique. eye gaze can potentially be faster and more ergonomic, but suffers from low accuracy due to calibration errors and drift of wearable eye-tracking sensors. this work investigates precise, multimodal selection techniques using head motion and eye gaze. a comparison of speed and pointing accuracy reveals the relative merits of each method, including the achievable target size for robust selection. we demonstrate and discuss example applications for augmented reality, including compact menus with deep structure, and a proof-of-concept method for on-line correction of calibration drift.",80
Sketch&Stitch: Interactive Embroidery for E-textiles,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656650,"e-textiles are fabrics that integrate electronic circuits and components. makers use them to create interactive clothing, furniture, and toys. however, this requires significant manual labor and skills, and using technology-centric design tools. we introduce sketch&stitch, an interactive embroidery system to create e-textiles using a traditional crafting approach: users draw their art and circuit directly on fabric using colored pens. the system takes a picture of the sketch, converts it to embroidery patterns, and sends them to an embroidery machine. alternating between sketching and stitching, users build and test their design incrementally. sketch&stitch features circuitry stickers representing circuit boards, components, and custom stitch patterns for wire crossings to insulate, and various textile touch sensors such as pushbuttons, sliders, and 2d touchpads. circuitry stickers serve as placeholders during design. using computer vision, they are recognized and replaced later in the appropriate embroidery phases. we close with technical considerations and application examples.",81
Using Stakeholder Theory to Examine Drivers' Stake in Uber,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656651,"uber is a ride-sharing platform that is part of the 'gig-economy,' where the platform supports and coordinates a labor market in which there are a large number of ephemeral, piecemeal jobs. despite numerous efforts to understand the impacts of these platforms and their algorithms on uber drivers, how to better serve and support drivers with these platforms remains an open challenge. in this paper, we frame uber through the lens of stakeholder theory to highlight drivers' position in the workplace, which helps inform the design of a more ethical and effective platform. to this end, we analyzed uber drivers' forum discussions about their lived experiences of working with the uber platform. we identify and discuss the impact of the stakes that drivers have in relation to both the uber corporation and their passengers, and look at how these stakes impact both the platform and drivers' practices.",82
"Conversations in the Eye of the Storm: At-Scale Features of Conversational Structure in a High-Tempo, High-Stakes Microblogging Environment",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656652,"this work propels social media research beyond the single post as the unit of analysis toward fuller treatment of interaction by making the construct of the conversation analytically available. we offer a method for constructing @reply conversations in twitter to apprehend social media conversational features at scale. we apply this method to the high-tempo, high-stakes environment of 2012's hurricane sandy, with its high volume of online talk by affected locals and distinct disaster-stage phasing by which to consider interactional difference. we investigate the temporality of conversations; the relationality of who speaks to whom; the number and kind of conversationalists; and how content affects temporal features. the analysis reveals that, during the height of the emergency, people expand conversations both in number and kind of conversational partners-just as their information search intensifies. this expansion contributes to longer, slower-paced conversations in the high-emergency period, suggesting reliance on online relationships during times of greatest uncertainty.",83
Interactive Extraction of Examples from Existing Code,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656653,"programmers frequently learn from examples produced and shared by other programmers. however, it can be challenging and time-consuming to produce concise, working code examples. we conducted a formative study where 12 participants made examples based on their own code. this revealed a key hurdle: making meaningful simplifications without introducing errors. based on this insight, we designed a mixed-initiative tool, codescoop, to help programmers extract executable, simplified code from existing code. codescoop enables programmers to ""scoop"" out a relevant subset of code. techniques include selectively including control structures and recording an execution trace that allows authors to substitute literal values for code and variables. in a controlled study with 19 participants, codescoop helped programmers extract executable code examples with the intended behavior more easily than with a standard code editor.",84
"Haptic Revolver: Touch, Shear, Texture, and Shape Rendering on a Reconfigurable Virtual Reality Controller",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656654,"we present haptic revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. haptic revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. as the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. the wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. we evaluated haptic revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. we also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.",85
Influences of Human Cognition and Visual Behavior on Password Strength during Picture Password Composition,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656665,"visual attention, search, processing and comprehension are important cognitive tasks during a graphical password composition activity. aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (n=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. the analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (n=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users' differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password's strength within graphical user authentication realms.",86
Supporting Workplace Detachment and Reattachment with Conversational Intelligence,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656666,"research has shown that productivity is mediated by an individual's ability to detach from their work at the end of the day and reattach with it when they return the next day. in this paper we explore the extent to which structured dialogues, focused on individuals' work-related tasks or emotions, can help them with the detachment and reattachment processes. our inquiry is driven with switchbot, a conversational bot which engages with workers at the start and end of their work day. after preliminarily validating the design of a detachment and reattachment dialogue frame-work with 108 crowdworkers, we study switchbot's use in-situ for 14 days with 34 information workers. we find that workers send fewer e-mails after work hours and spend a larger percentage of their first hour at work using productivity applications than they normally would when using switchbot. further, we find that productivity gains were better sustained when conversations focused on work-related emotions. our results suggest that conversational bots can be effective tools for aiding workplace detachment and reattachment and help people make successful use of their time on and off the job.",87
iTurk: Turning Passive Haptics into Active Haptics by Making Users Reconfigure Props in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656667,"we present a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime. the main contribution of our system is that it does not require any actuators; instead, our system employs the user to reconfigure and actuate otherwise passive props. we demonstrate a foldable prop that users reconfigure to represent a suitcase, fuse cabinet, railing, and a seat. a second prop, suspended from a long pendulum, not only stands in for inanimate objects, but also for objects that move and demonstrate proactive behavior, such as a group of flying droids that physically attack the user. our approach conveys a sense of a living, animate world, when in reality the user is the only animate entity present in the system, complemented with only one or two physical props. in our study, participants rated their experience as more enjoyable and realistic than a corresponding no-haptics condition.",88
"Clusters, Trends, and Outliers: How Immersive Technologies Can Facilitate the Collaborative Analysis of Multidimensional Data",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656668,"immersive technologies such as augmented reality devices are opening up a new design space for the visual analysis of data. this paper studies the potential of an augmented reality environment for the purpose of collaborative analysis of multidimensional, abstract data. we present art, a collaborative analysis tool to visualize multidimensional data in augmented reality using an interactive, 3d parallel coordinates visualization. the visualization is anchored to a touch-sensitive tabletop, benefiting from well-established interaction techniques. the results of group-based, expert walkthroughs show that art can facilitate immersion in the data, a fluid analysis process, and collaboration. based on the results, we provide a set of guidelines and discuss future research areas to foster the development of immersive technologies as tools for the collaborative analysis of multidimensional data.",89
Methods for Evaluation of Imperfect Captioning Tools by Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Users at Different Reading Literacy Levels,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656669,"as automatic speech recognition (asr) improves in accuracy, it may become useful for transcribing spoken text in real-time for deaf and hard-of-hearing (dhh) individuals. to quantify users' comprehension and opinion of automatic captions, which inevitably contain some errors, we must identify appropriate methodologies for evaluation studies with dhh users, including quantitative measurement instruments suitable to the various literacy levels among the dhh population. a literature review guided our selection of several probes (e.g. multiple-choice comprehension-question accuracy or response time, scalar-questions about user estimation of asr errors or their impact, users' numerical estimation of accuracy), which we evaluated in a lab study with dhh users, wherein their literacy levels and the actual accuracy of each caption stimulus were factors. for some probes, participants with lower literacy had more positive subjective responses overall, and, for participants with particular literacy score ranges, some probes were insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between caption accuracy levels.",90
Effects of Individual Differences in Blocking Workplace Distractions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656660,"information workers are experiencing ever-increasing online distractions in the workplace, and software to block distractions is becoming more popular. we conducted an exploratory field study with 32 information workers in their workplace using software to block online distractions for one week. we discovered that with online distractions blocked, participants assessed their focus and productivity to be significantly higher. those who benefited most were those who reported being less in control of their work, associated with personality traits of lower conscientiousness and lack of perseverence. unexpectedly, those reporting higher control of work experienced a cost of higher workload with online distractions blocked. those who reported the greatest increase in focus with distractions blocked were those who were more susceptible to social media distractions. without distractions, people with higher control of work worked longer stretches without physical breaks, with consequently higher stress. we present design recommendations to promote focus for our observed coping behaviors.",91
Dynamic Demographics: Lessons from a Large-Scale Census of Performative Possibilities in Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656661,"while much popular discussion of representation in games exists, there is very little rigorously collected data available from which to draw direct conclusions. in this study, we set out to address this gap by performing a census of playable characters across a large sample of contemporary games. we gathered data from 200 games including independently published (""indie"") games and so-called ""aaa"" titles from large publishers. while our initial analysis yielded some insight into the landscape of playable characters, it also highlighted the contingent, negotiated, and interpretive nature of representation in games. this led to additional analysis that emphasized the ways in which this negotiation manifests in research in the methods and metrics used to quantify representation. we argue that researchers studying representation in games need to treat it as a possibility space for a multitude of potential interpretations rather than a singular, measurable, phenomenon.",92
Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656662,"this paper reports on a postphenomenological inquiry of six trained philosophers, who as study participants lived with and reflected on a research product we designed known as the tilting bowl: a ceramic bowl that unpredictably but gently tilts multiple times daily. the tilting bowl is a counterfactual artifact that is designed specifically for this study as part of a material speculation approach to design research. a postphenomenological inquiry looks to describe and analyze accounts of relationships between humans and technological artifacts, and how each mutually shapes the other through mediations that form the human subjectivity and objectivity of any given situation. this paper contributes an empirical account and analysis of the relations that emerged (background and alterity) and the relativistic views that co-constitute the philosophers, tilting bowl, and their specific worlds. the findings demonstrate the relevance of this philosophical framing to fundamentally and broadly understand how people engage digital artifacts.",93
LumiWatch: On-Arm Projected Graphics and Touch Input,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656663,"compact, worn computers with projected, on-skin touch interfaces have been a long-standing yet elusive goal, largely written off as science fiction. such devices offer the potential to mitigate the significant human input/output bottleneck inherent in worn devices with small screens. in this work, we present the first fully functional and self-contained projection smartwatch implementation, containing the requisite compute, power, projection and touch-sensing capabilities. our watch offers roughly 40 sq. cm of interactive surface area -- more than five times that of a typical smartwatch display. we demonstrate continuous 2d finger tracking with interactive, rectified graphics, transforming the arm into a touchscreen. we discuss our hardware and software implementation, as well as evaluation results regarding touch accuracy and projection visibility.",94
Hit-or-Wait: Coordinating Opportunistic Low-effort Contributions to Achieve Global Outcomes in On-the-go Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656664,"we consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. in order to design such ""on-the-go crowdsourcing"" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. we thus introduce hit-or-wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using hit-or-wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.",95
An Empirical Exploration of Mindfulness Design Using Solo Travel Domain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656675,"despite recent popularity of mindfulness smartphone applications and an interest in incorporating mindfulness into new technologies, existing applications tend to focus mainly on its meditation dimension. in this paper, we review existing literature on digital and traditional mindfulness to map its design space and synthesize the findings with our prior research on designing for aesthetic needs. we identify ""recollection"" and ""evaluation"" as two important dimensions of mindfulness that have not yet been incorporated into popular digital tools. through a two-phase design activity over 16 months, we developed coloraway, an innovative tool that promotes mindfulness through interaction with modified travel photos. recruited participants evaluated coloraway and offered unique insights into how mindfulness can be better designed. we also discuss how the process of designing for mindfulness can possibly inform the design of personal technology. this research is part of a larger study that builds on scholarly research and theories with the goal of designing interactive technologies for solo travelers.",96
Inspiring AWE: Transforming Clinic Waiting Rooms into Informal Learning Environments with Active Waiting Education,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656676,"this research explores patient education in pediatric hematology and oncology clinics. based on interviews, observations, and a review of existing patient materials, we argue that education in clinic waiting rooms is in need of reform. we applied design principles from research in science museums along with tangible interaction techniques to create the sickle cell station, an interactive learning experience about sickle cell disease. to evaluate the effectiveness of this design we observed approximately 580 participants in a pediatric hematology clinic waiting area in four different design conditions. these observations included detailed video analysis of 81 patients and their parents to understand their interaction and learning with the sickle cell station. our results show an engaging learning experience with relevant conversation, inquiry, and collaboration. we describe how patient engagement varied in the four design conditions and conclude with implications for new designs in the area of active waiting education (awe).",97
Object Manipulation in Virtual Reality Under Increasing Levels of Translational Gain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656677,"room-scale virtual reality (vr) has become an affordable consumer reality, with applications ranging from entertainment to productivity. however, the limited physical space available for room-scale vr in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. to solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of vr, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer vr. consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in vr for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. we suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a vr task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale vr.",98
Watch Me Play: Does Social Facilitation Apply to Digital Games?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656678,"the presence of observers and virtual characters can significantly shape our gaming experience. researchers suppose that most of the basic socio-psychological phenomena are also applicable for digital games. however, the social processes in gaming setups can differ from our experience in other social situations. our work emphasizes that awareness. insights are needed for the purposeful design of a game's social setting, specifically in applied contexts of learning and training. here, we focus on the social facilitation effect, which describes an unconscious change in performance due to the presence of others, by investigating the impact of real observers and virtual agents on player experience and performance in four different games. the results of our four studies show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, in-game success was not significantly influenced by the presence of any social entity, indicating that social facilitation does not generally apply to the context of playing digital games.",99
Do You Think What I Think: Perceptions of Delayed Instant Messages in Computer-Mediated Communication of Romantic Relations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656679,"in romantic relationships, instant messaging (im) can serve as a communication channel to maintain a sense of mutual presence and relational closeness when being physically separated. however, im is asynchronous by design. there can exist time delay for people to receive and reply to incoming messages, which may violate romantic partner's mutual expectation. limited understanding is available around how unintended and intended delays affect the relationship of romantic partners. this work examines how romantic partners grow, perceive, and use mutual knowledge about each other in delayed im to resolve the expectancy violation. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and used the diary entries as probes for post-study one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im. based on these findings, we propose several theoretical and practical implications.",100
From Research to Practice: Informing the Design of Autism Support Smart Technology,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656670,"smart technologies (wearable and mobile devices) show tremendous potential in the detection, diagnosis, and management of autism spectrum disorder (asd) by enabling continuous real-time data collection, identifying effective treatment strategies, and supporting intervention design and delivery. though promising, effective utilization of smart technology in aiding asd is still limited. we propose a set of implications to guide the design of asd-support technology by analyzing 149 peer-reviewed articles focused on children with autism from acm digital library, ieee xplore, and pubmed. our analysis reveals that technology should facilitate real-time detection and identification of points-of-interest, adapt its behavior driven by the real-time affective state of the user, utilize familiar and unfamiliar features depending on user-context, and aid in revealing even minuscule progress made by children with autism. our findings indicate that such technology should strive to blend-in with everyday objects. moreover, gradual exposure and desensitization may facilitate successful adaptation of novel technology.",101
Explanations as Mechanisms for Supporting Algorithmic Transparency,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656671,"transparency can empower users to make informed choices about how they use an algorithmic decision-making system and judge its potential consequences. however, transparency is often conceptualized by the outcomes it is intended to bring about, not the specifics of mechanisms to achieve those outcomes. we conducted an online experiment focusing on how different ways of explaining facebook's news feed algorithm might affect participants' beliefs and judgments about the news feed. we found that all explanations caused participants to become more aware of how the system works, and helped them to determine whether the system is biased and if they can control what they see. the explanations were less effective for helping participants evaluate the correctness of the system's output, and form opinions about how sensible and consistent its behavior is. we present implications for the design of transparency mechanisms in algorithmic decision-making systems based on these results.",102
On the Design of OLO Radio: Investigating Metadata as a Design Material,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656672,"with the massive adoption of music streaming services globally, metadata is being generated that captures people's music listening histories in more precise detail than ever before. these metadata archives offer a valuable and overlooked resource for designing new ways of supporting people in experiencing the music they have listened to over the course of their lives. yet, little research has demonstrated how metadata can be applied as a material in design practice. we describe the design of olo radio, a device that leverages music listening history metadata to support experiences of exploring and living with music from one's past. we unpack and reflect on design choices that made use of the exacting precision captured in listening history metadata archives to support relatively imprecise qualities of feedback and interaction to encourage rich, open-ended experiences of contemplation, curiosity, and enjoyment over time. we conclude with implications for hci research and practice in this space.",103
"Engage Early, Correct More: How Journalists Participate in False Rumors Online during Crisis Events",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656673,"journalists are struggling to adapt to new conditions of news production and simultaneously encountering criticism for their role in spreading misinformation. against the backdrop of this ""crisis in journalism"", this research seeks to understand how journalists are actually participating in the spread and correction of online rumors. we compare the engagement behaviors of journalists to non-journalists- and specifically other high visibility users-within five false rumors that spread on twitter during three crisis events. our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non-journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. however, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted-underscoring their continued role in shaping the news. interestingly, journalists scored high on ""power user"" measures, but were distinct from other power users in significant ways-e.g. by being more likely to deny rumors.",104
Measuring the “Why” of Interaction: Development and Validation of the User Motivation Inventory (UMI),https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656674,"motivation is a fundamental concept in understanding people's experiences and behavior. yet, motivation to engage with an interactive system has received only limited attention in hci. we report the development and validation of the user motivation inventory (umi). the umi is an 18-item multidimensional measure of motivation, rooted in self-determination theory (sdt). it is designed to measure intrinsic motivation, integrated, identified, introjected, and external regulation, as well as amotivation. results of two studies (total n = 941) confirm the six-factor structure of the umi with high reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity of each subscale. relationships with core concepts such as need satisfaction, vitality, and usability were studied. additionally, the umi was found to detect differences in motivation for people who consider abandoning a technology compared to those who do not question their use. the central role of motivation in users' behavior and experience is discussed.",105
GestureWiz: A Human-Powered Gesture Design Environment for User Interface Prototypes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656685,"designers and researchers often rely on simple gesture recognizers like wobbrock et al.'s $1 for rapid user interface prototypes. however, most existing recognizers are limited to a particular input modality and/or pre-trained set of gestures, and cannot be easily combined with other recognizers. in particular, creating prototypes that employ advanced touch and mid-air gestures still requires significant technical experience and programming skill. inspired by $1's easy, cheap, and flexible design, we present the gesturewiz prototyping environment that provides designers with an integrated solution for gesture definition, conflict checking, and real-time recognition by employing human recognizers in a wizard of oz manner. we present a series of experiments with designers and crowds to show that gesturewiz can perform with reasonable accuracy and latency. we demonstrate advantages of gesturewiz when recreating gesture-based interfaces from the literature and conducting a study with 12 interaction designers that prototyped a multimodal interface with support for a wide range of novel gestures in about 45 minutes.",106
In Search of the Dream Team: Temporally Constrained Multi-Armed Bandits for Identifying Effective Team Structures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656686,"team structures---roles, norms, and interaction patterns---define how teams work. hci researchers have theorized ideal team structures and built systems nudging teams towards them, such as those increasing turn-taking, deliberation, and knowledge distribution. however, organizational behavior research argues against the existence of universally ideal structures. teams are diverse and excel under different structures: while one team might flourish under hierarchical leadership and a critical culture, another will flounder. in this paper, we present dreamteam: a system that explores a large space of possible team structures to identify effective structures for each team based on observable feedback. to avoid overwhelming teams with too many changes, dreamteam introduces multi-armed bandits with temporal constraints: an algorithm that manages the timing of exploration--exploitation trade-offs across multiple bandits simultaneously. a field experiment demonstrated that dreamteam teams outperformed self-managing teams by 38%, manager-led teams by 46%, and teams with unconstrained bandits by 41%. this research advances computation as a powerful partner in establishing effective teamwork.",107
Troubling Vulnerability: Designing with LGBT Young People's Ambivalence Towards Hate Crime Reporting,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656687,"hci is increasingly working with 'vulnerable' people, yet there is a danger that the label of vulnerability can alienate and stigmatize the people such work aims to support. we report our study investigating the application of interaction design to increase rates of hate crime reporting amongst lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people. during design-led workshops, participants expressed ambivalence towards reporting. while recognizing their exposure to hate crime, they simultaneously rejected being identified as victim as implied in the act of reporting. we used visual communication design to depict the young people's ambivalent identities and contribute insights into how these fail and succeed to account for the intersectional, fluid and emergent nature of lgbt identities through the design research process. we argue that by producing ambiguously designed texts alongside conventional outcomes, we 'trouble' our design research narratives as a tactic to disrupt static and reductive understandings of vulnerability within hci.",108
PHUI-kit: Interface Layout and Fabrication on Curved 3D Printed Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656688,"we seek to make physical user interface (phui) design more like graphical user interface (gui) design by using a drag-and drop interface to place widgets, allowing widgets to be repositioned and by hiding implementation details. phuis are interfaces built from tangible widgets arranged on the surfaces of physical objects. phui layout will become more important as we move from rectangular screens to purpose-built interactive devices. approaches to phui layout based on sculpture make it difficult to reposition widgets, and software approaches do not involve placing widgets on the device exterior. we created phui-kit, a software approach to phui layout on 3d printed enclosures, which has a drag-and-drop interface, supports repositioning of widgets, and hides implementation details. we describe algorithms for placing widgets on curved surfaces, modifying the enclosure geometry, and routing wiring inside the enclosure. the tool is easy to use and supports a wide range of design possibilities.",109
Crowd-Guided Ensembles: How Can We Choreograph Crowd Workers for Video Segmentation?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656689,"in this work, we propose two ensemble methods leveraging a crowd workforce to improve video annotation, with a focus on video object segmentation. their shared principle is that while individual candidate results may likely be insufficient, they often complement each other so that they can be combined into something better than any of the individual results---the very spirit of collaborative working. for one, we extend a standard polygon-drawing interface to allow workers to annotate negative space, and combine the work of multiple workers instead of relying on a single best one as commonly done in crowdsourced image segmentation. for the other, we present a method to combine multiple automatic propagation algorithms with the help of the crowd. such combination requires an understanding of where the algorithms fail, which we gather using a novel coarse scribble video annotation task. we evaluate our ensemble methods, discuss our design choices for them, and make our web-based crowdsourcing tools and results publicly available.",110
Phone vs. Tangible in Museums: A Comparative Study,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656680,"despite years of hci research on digital technology in museums, it is still unclear how different interactions impact on visitors'. a comparative evaluation of smart replicas, phone app and smart cards looked at the personal preferences, behavioural change, and the appeal of mobiles in museums. 76 participants used all three interaction modes and gave their opinions in a questionnaire; participants interaction was also observed. the results show the phone is the most disliked interaction mode while tangible interaction (smart card and replica combined) is the most liked. preference for the phone favour mobility to the detriment of engagement with the exhibition. different behaviours when interacting with the phone or the tangibles where observed. the personal visiting style appeared to be only marginally affected by the device. visitors also expect museums to provide the phones against the current trend of developing apps in a ""bring your own device"" approach.",111
Evaluating User Satisfaction with Typography Designs via Mining Touch Interaction Data in Mobile Reading,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656681,"previous work has demonstrated that typography design has a great influence on users' reading experience. however, current typography design guidelines are mainly for general purpose, while the individual needs are nearly ignored. to achieve personalized typography designs, an important and necessary step is accurately evaluating user satisfaction with the typography designs. current evaluation approaches, e.g., asking for users' opinions directly, however, interrupt the reading and affect users' judgments. in this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge by mining users' implicit feedbacks, e.g., touch interaction data. we conduct two mobile reading studies in chinese to collect the touch interaction data from 91 participants. we propose various features based on our three hypotheses to capture meaningful patterns in the touch behaviors. the experiment results show the effectiveness of our evaluation models with higher accuracy on comparing with the baseline under three text difficulty levels, respectively.",112
"Keeping a Low Profile?: Technology, Risk and Privacy among Undocumented Immigrants",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656682,"undocumented immigrants in the united states face risks of discrimination, surveillance, and deportation. we investigate their technology use, risk perceptions, and protective strategies relating to their vulnerability. through semi-structured interviews with latinx undocumented immigrants, we find that while participants act to address offline threats, this vigilance does not translate to their online activities. their technology use is shaped by needs and benefits rather than risk perceptions. while our participants are concerned about identity theft and privacy generally, and some raise concerns about online harassment, their understanding of government surveillance risks is vague and met with resignation. we identify tensions among self-expression, group privacy, and self-censorship related to their immigration status, as well as strong trust in service providers. our findings have implications for digital literacy education, privacy and security interfaces, and technology design in general. even minor design decisions can substantially affect exposure risks and well-being for such vulnerable communities.",113
Comparing Computer-Based Drawing Methods for Blind People with Real-Time Tactile Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656683,"in this paper, we present a drawing workstation for blind people using a two-dimensional tactile pin-matrix display for in- and output. four different input modalities, namely menu-based, gesture-based, freehand-stylus and a time-of-flight (tof) depth segmentation of real-world object silhouettes, are utilized to create graphical shapes. users can freely manipulate shapes after creation. twelve blind users evaluated and compared the four image creation modalities. during evaluation, participants had to copy four different images. the results show that all modalities are highly appropriate for non-visual drawing tasks. there is no generally preferred drawing modality, but most participants rated the robust and well-known menu-based interaction as very good. furthermore, menu was second in performance and the most accurate drawing modality. our evaluation demonstrated direct manipulation works well for blind users at the position of the reading hand. in general, our drawing tool allows blind users to create appealing images.",114
Enabling People with Visual Impairments to Navigate Virtual Reality with a Haptic and Auditory Cane Simulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656684,"traditional virtual reality (vr) mainly focuses on visual feedback, which is not accessible for people with visual impairments. we created canetroller, a haptic cane controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3d auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions. we designed indoor and outdoor vr scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller. our study showed that canetroller was a promising tool that enabled visually impaired participants to navigate different virtual spaces. we discuss potential applications supported by canetroller ranging from entertainment to mobility training.",115

Exploring New Metaphors for a Networked World through the File Biography,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656696,"we present a body of work undertaken in response to the challenge outlined by harper et al. in their paper, ?'what is a file?' [9]. through a conceptual and design-led exploration of new file metaphors, we developed the 'file biography', a digital entity that encompasses the provenance of a file and allows the user to keep track of how it propagates. we explored this through prototyping and utilised it in two user studies. in the studies, we (i) asked people to sketch out file biographies for their own content, and (ii) deployed a tool enabling users to build their own simple file biographies across multiple versions of word documents. we conclude that new file metaphors may need to play different roles for different types of digital content, with a distinction being drawn between content that is 'in production' and virtual possessions that are, in a sense, a 'finished' artefact.",117
Understanding Older Users' Acceptance of Wearable Interfaces for Sensor-based Fall Risk Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656697,"algorithms processing data from wearable sensors promise to more accurately predict risks of falling -- a significant concern for older adults. substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. we present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. a participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. we then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. we also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.",118
How People Form Folk Theories of Social Media Feeds and What it Means for How We Study Self-Presentation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656698,"self-presentation is a process that is significantly complicated by the rise of algorithmic social media feeds, which obscure information about one's audience and environment. user understandings of these systems, and therefore user ability to adapt to them, are limited, and have recently been explored through the lens of folk theories. to date, little is understood of how these theories are formed, and how they tie to the self-presentation process in social media. this paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study. results suggest that people draw from diverse sources of information when forming folk theories, and that folk theories are more complex, multifaceted and malleable than previously assumed. this highlights the need to integrate folk theories into both social media systems and theories of self-presentation.",119
Analogy Mining for Specific Design Needs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656699,"finding analogical inspirations in distant domains is a powerful way of solving problems. however, as the number of inspirations that could be matched and the dimensions on which that matching could occur grow, it becomes challenging for designers to find inspirations relevant to their needs. furthermore, designers are often interested in exploring specific aspects of a product-- for example, one designer might be interested in improving the brewing capability of an outdoor coffee maker, while another might wish to optimize for portability. in this paper we introduce a novel system for targeting analogical search for specific needs. specifically, we contribute an analogical search engine for expressing and abstracting specific design needs that returns more distant yet relevant inspirations than alternate approaches.",120

Data Illustrator: Augmenting Vector Design Tools with Lazy Data Binding for Expressive Visualization Authoring,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656691,"building graphical user interfaces for visualization authoring is challenging as one must reconcile the tension between flexible graphics manipulation and procedural visualization generation based on a graphical grammar or declarative languages. to better support designers' workflows and practices, we propose data illustrator, a novel visualization framework. in our approach, all visualizations are initially vector graphics; data binding is applied when necessary and only constrains interactive manipulation to that data bound property. the framework augments graphic design tools with new concepts and operators, and describes the structure and generation of a variety of visualizations. based on the framework, we design and implement a visualization authoring system. the system extends interaction techniques in modern vector design tools for direct manipulation of visualization configurations and parameters. we demonstrate the expressive power of our approach through a variety of examples. a qualitative study shows that designers can use our framework to compose visualizations.",122
Safety vs. Surveillance: What Children Have to Say about Mobile Apps for Parental Control,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656692,"mobile applications (""apps"") developed to promote online safety for children are underutilized and rely heavily on parental control features that monitor and restrict their child's mobile activities. this asymmetry in parental surveillance initiates an interesting research question -- how do children themselves feel about such parental control apps? we conducted a qualitative analysis of 736 reviews of 37 mobile online safety apps from google play that were publicly posted and written by children (ages 8-19). our results indicate that child ratings were significantly lower than that of parents with 76% of the child reviews giving apps a single star. children felt that the apps were overly restrictive and invasive of their personal privacy, negatively impacting their relationships with their parents. we relate these findings with hci literature on mobile online safety, including broader literature around privacy and surveillance, and outline design opportunities for online safety apps.",123
Co-performance: Conceptualizing the Role of Artificial Agency in the Design of Everyday Life,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656693,"this paper introduces the notion of co-performance, with the aim to offer human-computer interaction (hci) researchers and practitioners a new perspective on the role of artificial agency in everyday life, from automated systems to autonomous devices. in contrast to 'smartness,' which focuses on a supposed autonomy of artifacts, co-performance considers artifacts as capable of learning and performing next to people. this shifts the locus of design from matters of distributions of agency at design time, to matters of embodied learning in everyday practice for both human and artificial performers. from this perspective, co-performance acknowledges the dynamic differences in capabilities between humans and artifacts, and highlights the fundamentally recursive relation between professional design and use. implications for hci design practice are unpacked through reflections on smart thermostat design in light of historic changes in roles between humans and heating systems, and changing ideas of appropriateness in everyday practices of domestic heating.",124
Social Influence and Reciprocity in Online Gift Giving,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656694,"giving gifts is a fundamental part of human relationships that is being affected by technology. the internet enables people to give at the last minute and over long distances, and to observe friends giving and receiving gifts. how online gift giving spreads in social networks is therefore important to understand. we examine 1.5 million gift exchanges on facebook and show that receiving a gift causes individuals to be 56% more likely to give a gift in the future. additional surveys show that online gift giving was more socially acceptable to those who learned about it by observing friends' participation instead of a non-social encouragement. most receivers pay the gift forward instead of reciprocating directly online, although surveys revealed additional instances of direct reciprocity, where the initial gifting occurred offline. thus, social influence promotes the spread of online gifting, which both complements and substitutes for offline gifting.",125

Breaking the Tracking: Enabling Weight Perception using Perceivable Tracking Offsets,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656606,"virtual reality (vr) technology strives to enable a highly immersive experience for the user by including a wide variety of modalities (e.g. visuals, haptics). current vr hardware however lacks a sufficient way of communicating the perception of weight of an object, resulting in scenarios where users can not distinguish between lifting a bowling ball or a feather. we propose a solely software based approach of simulating weight in vr by deliberately using perceivable tracking offsets. these tracking offsets nudge users to lift their arm higher and result in a visual and haptic perception of weight. we conducted two user studies showing that participants intuitively associated them with the sensation of weight and accept them as part of the virtual world. we further show that compared to no weight simulation, our approach led to significantly higher levels of presence, immersion and enjoyment. finally, we report perceptional thresholds and offset boundaries as design guidelines for practitioners.",127
Remixed Reality: Manipulating Space and Time in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656607,"we present remixed reality, a novel form of mixed reality. in contrast to classical mixed reality approaches where users see a direct view or video feed of their environment, with remixed reality they see a live 3d reconstruction, gathered from multiple external depth cameras. this approach enables changing the environment as easily as geometry can be changed in virtual reality, while allowing users to view and interact with the actual physical world as they would in augmented reality. we characterize a taxonomy of manipulations that are possible with remixed reality: spatial changes such as erasing objects; appearance changes such as changing textures; temporal changes such as pausing time; and viewpoint changes that allow users to see the world from different points without changing their physical location. we contribute a method that uses an underlying voxel grid holding information like visibility and transformations, which is applied to live geometry in real time.",128
Mapping Machine Learning Advances from HCI Research to Reveal Starting Places for Design Innovation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656608,"hci has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ml) to improve user experience (ux). however, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ml might improve ux. we investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related hci research publications. our review confirmed a lack of research integrating ux and ml. to help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ml technical capabilities within hci. among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. to help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. the clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ml technology to improve people's lives.",129

Understanding Identity Presentation in Medical Crowdfunding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656602,"people desire to present themselves favorably to others. however, medical crowdfunding beneficiaries are often expected to present their dire medical conditions and financial straits to solicit financial support. to investigate how beneficiaries convey their situation on medical crowdfunding pages and how contributors perceive the presented information, we interviewed both medical crowdfunding beneficiaries and contributors. while beneficiaries emphasized the serious of their medical situations to signal their deservedness of support, contributor participants gave less attention to that content. rather, they focused on their impression of the beneficiary's character formed by various features of contributions such as the contributor's names, messages, and shared pictures. these contribution features further signaled common connections between the beneficiary and contributors and each contributor's unique involvement in the beneficiary's medical journey. however, the contribution amount resulted in judgement about other contributors. we suggest design opportunities and challenges that apply these results to the design of medical crowdfunding interfaces.",133
Pocket Transfers: Interaction Techniques for Transferring Content from Situated Displays to Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656603,"we present pocket transfers: interaction techniques that allow users to transfer content from situated displays to a personal mobile device while keeping the device in a pocket or bag. existing content transfer solutions require direct manipulation of the mobile device, making inter-action slower and less flexible. our introduced tech-niques employ touch, mid-air gestures, gaze, and a mul-timodal combination of gaze and mid-air gestures. we evaluated the techniques in a novel user study (n=20), where we considered dynamic scenarios where the user approaches the display, completes the task, and leaves. we show that all pocket transfer techniques are fast and seen as highly convenient. mid-air gestures are the most efficient touchless method for transferring a single item, while the multimodal method is the fastest touchless method when multiple items are transferred. we provide guidelines to help researchers and practitioners choose the most suitable content transfer techniques for their systems.",134

The Effects of Adding Search Functionality to Interactive Visualizations on the Web,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655417,"the widespread use of text-based search in user interfaces has led designers in visualization to occasionally add search functionality to their creations. yet it remains unclear how search may impact a person's behavior. given the unstructured context of the web, users may not have explicit information-seeking goals and designers cannot make assumptions about user attention. to bridge this gap, we observed the impact of integrating search with five visualizations across 830 online participants. in an unguided task, we find that (1) the presence of text-based search influences people's information-seeking goals, (2) search can alter the data that people explore and how they engage with it, and (3) the effects of search are amplified in visualizations where people are familiar with the underlying dataset. these results suggest that text-search in web visualizations drives users towards more diverse information seeking goals, and may be valuable in a range of existing visualization designs.",136

Designing Coherent Gesture Sets for Multi-scale Navigation on Tabletops,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655412,"multi-scale navigation interfaces were originally designed to enable single users to explore large visual information spaces on desktop workstations. these interfaces can also be quite useful on tabletops. however, their adaptation to co-located multi-user contexts is not straightforward. the literature describes different interfaces, that only offer a limited subset of navigation actions. in this paper, we first identify a comprehensive set of actions to effectively support multi-scale navigation. we report on a guessability study in which we elicited user-defined gestures for triggering these actions, showing that there is no natural design solution, but that users heavily rely on the now-ubiquitous slide, pinch and turn gestures. we then propose two interface designs based on this set of three basic gestures: one involves two-hand variations on these gestures, the other combines them with widgets. a comparative study suggests that users can easily learn both, and that the gesture-based, visually-minimalist design is a viable option, that saves display space for other controls.",141
HindSight: Enhancing Spatial Awareness by Sonifying Detected Objects in Real-Time 360-Degree Video,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655413,"our perception of our surrounding environment is limited by the constraints of human biology. the field of augmented perception asks how our sensory capabilities can be usefully extended through computational means. we argue that spatial awareness can be enhanced by exploiting recent advances in computer vision which make high-accuracy, real-time object detection feasible in everyday settings. we introduce hindsight, a wearable system that increases spatial awareness by detecting relevant objects in live 360-degree video and sonifying their position and class through bone conduction headphones. hindsight uses a deep neural network to locate and attribute semantic information to objects surrounding a user through a head-worn panoramic camera. it then uses bone conduction headphones, which preserve natural auditory acuity, to transmit audio notifications for detected objects of interest. we develop an application using hindsight to warn cyclists of approaching vehicles outside their field of view and evaluate it in an exploratory study with 15 users. participants reported increases in perceived safety and awareness of approaching vehicles when using hindsight.",142
Uncertainty Displays Using Quantile Dotplots or CDFs Improve Transit Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655414,"everyday predictive systems typically present point predictions, making it hard for people to account for uncertainty when making decisions. evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. in a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97% of optimal(95% ci: [95%,98%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95% ci: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95% ci:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95% ci: [2,6]).cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated. we discuss implications for real time transit predictions and possible generalization to other domains.",143
What to Put on the User: Sensing Technologies for Studies and Physiology Aware Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655425,"fitness trackers not just provide easy means to acquire physiological data in real-world environments due to affordable sensing technologies, they further offer opportunities for physiology-aware applications and studies in hci; however, their performance is not well understood. in this paper, we report findings on the quality of 3 sensing technologies: ppg-based wrist trackers (apple watch, microsoft band 2), an ecg-belt (polar h7) and reference device with stick-on ecg electrodes (nexus 10). we collected physiological (heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature) and subjective data from 21 participants performing combinations of physical activity and stressful tasks. our empirical research indicates that wrist devices provide a good sensing performance in stationary settings. however, they lack accuracy when participants are mobile or if tasks require physical activity. based on our findings, we suggest a textitdesign space for wearables in research settings and reflected on the appropriateness of the investigated technologies in research contexts.",144
Lost in Migration: Information Management and Community Building in an Online Health Community,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655426,"the ever-growing volume of information within online health communities (ohcs) presents an urgent need for new solutions that improve the efficiency of information organization and retrieval for their members. to meet this need, ohcs may choose to adopt off-the-shelf platforms that provide novel features for information management, but were not specifically designed to meet these communities' needs. the questions remain, however, as to the impact of these new platforms on social dynamics within ohcs and their well-being. to examine these questions, we qualitatively studied a migration of a popular ohc, focusing on diabetes self-management, between two off-the-shelf social computing platforms. despite improving information management, the migration served as a catalyst to reveal the importance of features for identity management and closed circle communication that were not apparent to either the management or the membership of the community. we describe the study and draw implications for research and design for ohcs.",145
On Visual Granularity: Collocated Sales Meeting Interactions in the Machine Industry,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655427,"visual representations are being used in typical sales meetings of the machine industry to exchange information and support social interactions. in these meetings, sales representatives design for granularity by taking into account verbal and visual details of communication. our article builds on increasingly occurring collocated interactions in sales meetings investigating the social relevance of mobile devices in face-to-face settings. the article aims to understand the supporting and disturbing role of visual granularity in sales meetings and develops design implications for interaction designers. we conducted an ethnographic study of sales meetings in material handling and paper machine industries, including conversation analysis (ca) of video recordings, and involving groups of professional analysts that are seldom used in hci. our findings draw evidence from sales meetings and design processes on successful and unsuccessful use of granularity in visual representations. finally, we propose seven design guidelines for visual granularity striving to understand buyers' perceptions and visual qualities.",146
Distance and Attraction: Gravity Models for Geographic Content Production,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655428,"volunteered geographic information (vgi), such as contributions to openstreetmap and geotagged wikipedia articles, is often assumed to be produced locally. however, recent work has found that peer-produced vgi is frequently contributed by non-locals. we evaluate this approach across hundreds of content types from wikipedia, openstreetmap, and ebird, and show that these models can describe more than 90% of ""vgi flows"" for some content types. our findings advance geographic hci theory, suggesting some spatial mechanisms underpinning vgi production. we also discuss design implications that can help (a) human and algorithmic consumers of vgi evaluate the perspectives it contains and (b) address geographic coverage variations in these platforms (e.g. via more effective volunteer recruitment strategies).",147

Visuo-Haptic Illusions for Improving the Perceived Performance of Shape Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655420,"in this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. to address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved.",149
A Schnittmuster for Crafting Context-Sensitive Toolkits,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655421,"diy-making can be an expensive pastime if makers are relying on ready-made toolkits, specialised materials and off-shelf components. many prefabricated commercial kits seek to lower the learning barrier of making and to help beginners to successfully take their first steps in engineering. however, as soon as the novices become a little more advanced, these toolkits often do not fit the specific requirements of personal maker projects anymore. we introduce the idea of a schnittmuster (or a meta-toolkit) as a novel approach to toolkit design that seeks to address these creativity-limiting factors as well as practical entrance hurdles. to demonstrate the adaptive power of the schnittmuster concept, we discuss an exemplar in the context of capacitive touch sensing (flexe-touch). implemented under the constraints of materials, user skill sets and making environments, we illustrate how the schnittmuster facilitated four cheap and flexible toolkit instantiations for crafting custom touch sensor electrodes.",150
Repurposing Emoji for Personalised Communication: Why 🍕 means “I love you”,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655422,"the use of emoji in digital communication can convey a wealth of emotions and concepts that otherwise would take many words to express. emoji have become a popular form of communication, with researchers claiming emoji represent a type of ""ubiquitous language"" that can span different languages. in this paper however, we explore how emoji are also used in highly personalised and purposefully secretive ways. we show that emoji are repurposed for something other than their ""intended"" use between close partners, family members and friends. we present the range of reasons why certain emoji get chosen, including the concept of ""emoji affordance"" and explore why repurposing occurs. normally used for speed, some emoji are instead used to convey intimate and personal sentiments that, for many reasons, their users cannot express in words. we discuss how this form of repurposing must be considered in tasks such as emoji-based sentiment analysis.",151
More Stars or More Reviews?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655423,"the large majority of reputation systems use features such as star ratings and reviews to give users a reputation in online peer-to-peer markets. both have been shown to be effective for signaling trustworthiness. however, the exact extent to which these features can change perceptions of users' trustworthiness remains an open question. using data from an online experiment conducted on airbnb users, we investigate which of the two types of reputation information --average star rating or the number of reviews --is more important for signaling a user's trustworthiness. we find that the relative effectiveness of ratings and reviews differ depending on whether reputation has a strong or a weak differentiation power. our findings show that reputation effects are contingent on and susceptible to the context created by the alternative choices presented to users, highlighting how reputation information is displayed can drastically alter their efficacy for engendering trust.",152
Self-Reflection and Personal Physicalization Construction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655424,"self-reflection is a central goal of personal informatics systems, and constructing visualizations from physical tokens has been found to help people reflect on data. however, so far, constructive physicalization has only been studied in lab environments with provided datasets. our qualitative study investigates the construction of personal physicalizations in people's domestic environments over 2-4 weeks. it contributes an understanding of (1) the process of creating personal physicalizations, (2) the types of personal insights facilitated, (3) the integration of self-reflection in the physicalization process, and (4) its benefits and challenges for self-reflection. we found that in constructive personal physicalization, data collection, construction and self-reflections are deeply intertwined. this extends previous models of visualization creation and data-driven self-reflection. we outline how benefits such as reflection through manual construction, personalization, and presence in everyday life can be transferred to a wider set of digital and physical systems.",153
G2G: The Design and Evaluation of a Shared Calendar and Messaging System for Grandparents and Grandchildren,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655435,"distance separated grandparents and grandchildren often face challenges in staying connected. to explore this topic, we designed g2g, a shared calendar and video messaging system to connect young children (ages 5-10) with their grandparents over distance. our design focused on providing grandparents and grandchildren with an awareness of each other's lives to support conversations and design elements to help reduce the need for parent scaffolding. a field study with two grandparent-grandchild pairs over two months showed that systems designed around structured communication can help young children develop a routine around staying in touch with their remote grandparents. autonomy in maintaining awareness can help children to be engaged more easily. this suggests that designs focusing on connecting young children to their grandparents over distance should be flexible yet structured and designing to reduce parental scaffolding can lead to positive effects and strengthened relationships.",154
Playing Close to Home: Interaction and Emerging Play in Outdoor Play Installations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655436,"outdoor play is becoming an increasingly marginalised activity in the urban landscape. even in hci, research on interactive solutions for outdoor play has largely been limited to special areas and in particular playgrounds. but children play everywhere, and especially play close to home is central in children's play activities. in this article we draw upon knowledge about designing for children's play in interaction design as well as in landscape architecture, to study how interactive play installations can be integrated in outdoor environments of a residential area. we present a field study in which digitally enhanced play installations were installed, in dialogue with the landscape, in between the buildings of a residential area. we focus on how emerging play activities made use of the installations as well as of the surrounding landscape in expected as well as unexpected ways. based on the observations, we discuss how residential play is special, and how this affects how to design for it.",155

Announcing Pregnancy Loss on Facebook: A Decision-Making Framework for Stigmatized Disclosures on Identified Social Network Sites,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655438,"pregnancy loss is a common experience that is often not disclosed in spite of potential disclosure benefits such as social support. to understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the u.s. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. we developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites (sns) such as facebook. we introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified snss. we find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. caution: this paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",157
Conceptualizing Disagreement in Qualitative Coding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655439,"collaborative qualitative coding often involves coders assign- ing different labels to the same instance, leading to ambiguity. we refer to such an instance of ambiguity as disagreement in coding. analyzing reasons for such a disagreement is essential-- both for purposes of bolstering user understanding gained from coding and reinterpreting the data collaboratively, and for negotiating user-assigned labels for building effective machine learning models. we propose a conceptual definition of collective disagreement using diversity and divergence within the coding distributions. this perspective of disagreement translates to diverse coding contexts and groups of coders irrespective of discipline. we introduce two tree-based ranking metrics as standardized ways of comparing disagreements in how data instances have been coded. we empirically validate that, of the two tree-based metrics, coders' perceptions of dis- agreement match more closely with the n-ary tree metric than with the post-traversal tree metric.",158
Intermodulation: Improvisation and Collaborative Art Practice for HCI,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655430,"this paper integrates theory, ethnography, and collaborative artwork to explore improvisational activity as both topic and tool of multidisciplinary hci inquiry. building on theories of improvisation drawn from art, music, hci and social science, and two ethnographic studies based on interviews, participant observation and collaborative art practice, we seek to elucidate the improvisational nature of practice in both art and ordinary action, including human-computer interaction. we identify five key features of improvisational action -- reflexivity, transgression, tension, listening, and interdependence -- and show how these can deepen and extend both linear and open-ended methodologies in hci and design. we conclude by highlighting collaborative engagement based on 'intermodulation' as a tool of multidisciplinary inquiry for hci research and design.",159
OptiMo: Optimization-Guided Motion Editing for Keyframe Character Animation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655431,"the mission of animators is to create nuanced, high-quality character motions. to achieve this, the careful editing of animation curves---curves that determine how a series of keyframed poses are interpolated over time---is an important task. manual editing affords full and precise control, but requires tedious and nonintuitive trials and errors. numerical optimization can automate such exploration; however, automatic solutions cannot always be perfect, and it is difficult for animators to control optimization owing to its black-box behavior. in this paper, we present a new framework called optimization-guided motion editing, which is aimed at maintaining a sense of full control while utilizing the power of optimization. we have designed interactions and developed a set of mathematical formulations to enable them. we discuss the framework's potential by demonstrating several usage scenarios with our proof-of-concept system, named optimo.",160

Time-Turner: Designing for Reflection and Remembrance of Moments in the Home,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656558,"families preserve memories of their special and everyday experiences, though it can be hard to capture all these moments in everyday life. we explore the concept of automated forms of capturing family life and presenting them through situated, tangible everyday artifacts in the home. we designed time-turner, an always-on video recording system along with a set of three drink coasters that allow family members to easily search, filter and replay videos to connect to their past. we engaged households in speculative enactments and interviews to explore the design space. our findings point to the value of witnessing real rather than staged moments and the ways in which the affordances of everyday artifacts can allow media to be 'lived with' as a part of everyday life. yet our design also revealed tensions around sharing and changing perceptions across time and generations. this points to design challenges around safeguarding this media and capturing 'reality' as opposed to curated content.",177
Webcam Covering as Planned Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656559,"most of today's laptops come with an integrated webcam placed above the screen to enable video conferencing. due to the risk of webcam spying attacks, some laptop users seem to be concerned about their privacy and seek protection by covering the webcam. this paper is the first to investigate personal characteristics and beliefs of users with and without webcam covers by applying the theory of planned behavior. we record the privacy behavior of 180 users, develop a path model, and analyze it by applying partial least squares. the analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users' decision to use a webcam cover. rather, this behavior is influenced by users' attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy. developers should take this as a lesson to design privacy enhancing technologies which are convenient, verifiably effective and endorsed by peers.",178
WrisText: One-handed Text Entry on Smartwatch using Wrist Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656550,"we present wristext - a one-handed text entry technique for smartwatches using the joystick-like motion of the wrist. a user enters text by whirling the wrist of the watch hand, towards six directions which each represent a key in a circular keyboard, and where the letters are distributed in an alphabetical order. the design of wristext was an iterative process, where we first conducted a study to investigate optimal key size, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90% striking accuracy. we then computed an optimal keyboard layout, considering a joint optimization problem of striking accuracy, striking comfort, word disambiguation. we evaluated the performance of wristext through a five-day study with 10 participants in two text entry scenarios: hand-up and hand-down. on average, participants achieved a text entry speed of 9.9 wpm across all sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 wpm by the end of the last day.",179
Off-Line Sensing: Memorizing Interactions in Passive 3D-Printed Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656551,"embedding sensors into objects allow them to recognize various interactions. however, sensing usually requires active electronics that are often costly, need time to be assembled, and constantly draw power. thus, we propose off-line sensing: passive 3d-printed sensors that detect one-time interactions, such as accelerating or flipping, but neither require active electronics nor power at the time of the interaction. they memorize a pre-defined interaction via an embedded structure filled with a conductive medium (e.g., a liquid). whether a sensor was exposed to the interaction can be read-out via a capacitive touchscreen. sensors are printed in a single pass on a consumer-level 3d printer. through a series of experiments, we show the feasibility of off-line sensing.",180
Social Computing-Driven Activism in Youth Empowerment Organizations: Challenges and Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656552,"throughout the world, organizations empower youth to participate in civic engagement to impact social change, and adult-youth collaborations are instrumental to the success of such initiatives. however, little is known about how technology supports this activism work, despite the fact that tools such as social networking applications (snas) are increasingly being leveraged in such contexts. we report results from a qualitative study of sna use within a youth empowerment organization. using the analytical lens of object-oriented publics, our findings reveal opportunities and challenges that youth and staff face when they use snas. we describe the illegibility of youth outreach efforts on snas, and how this illegibility complicated staff attempts to hold youth accountable. we also characterize how youth and staff differed in what they felt were socially appropriate uses of sna features, and tensions that arose in the co-use of these tools. we conclude with implications for the design of collaborative technologies that support youth-led activism in organizational contexts.",181
AdaM: Adapting Multi-User Interfaces for Collaborative Environments in Real-Time,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656553,"developing cross-device multi-user interfaces (uis) is a challenging problem. there are numerous ways in which content and interactivity can be distributed. however, good solutions must consider multiple users, their roles, their preferences and access rights, as well as device capabilities. manual and rule-based solutions are tedious to create and do not scale to larger problems nor do they adapt to dynamic changes, such as users leaving or joining an activity. in this paper, we cast the problem of ui distribution as an assignment problem and propose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. we present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time applications in dynamically changing collaborative settings. it optimizes the allocation of ui elements based on device capabilities, user roles, preferences, and access rights. we present a proof-of-concept designer-in-the-loop tool, allowing for quick solution exploration. finally, we compare our approach to traditional paper prototyping in a lab study.",182
SymbiosisSketch: Combining 2D & 3D Sketching for Designing Detailed 3D Objects in Situ,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656554,"we present symbiosissketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3d) and on a drawing surface (2d) to create detailed 3d designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (ar) setting. symbiosissketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3d (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2d (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3d conceptual design. a defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3d curves. these surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3d canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2d tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3d sketch. symbiosissketch users draw interchangeably on a 2d tablet or in 3d within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in ar. our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.",183
Video Game Selection Procedures For Experimental Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656565,"videogames are complex stimuli, and selecting games that consistently induce a desired player experience (px) in an experimental setting can be challenging. the number of relatively high-quality games being released each year continues to increase, which makes deriving a shortlist of plausible candidate games from this pool increasingly problematic. despite this, guidance for structuring and reporting on the game selection process remains limited. this paper therefore proposes two approaches to game selection: the first leverages online videogame databases and existing px research, and is structured with respect to widely-applicable videogame metadata. the second process applies established game design theory to serve researchers when insufficient connections between desired px outcomes and recognisable game elements exist. both methods are accompanied by example reports of their application. the present work aims to assist experimental researchers in selecting videogames likely to meet their needs, while encouraging more rigorous standards of reporting in the field.",184
Animated Edge Textures in Node-Link Diagrams: a Design Space and Initial Evaluation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656566,"network edge data attributes are usually encoded using color, opacity, stroke thickness and stroke pattern, or some combination thereof. in addition to these static variables, it is also possible to animate dynamic particles flowing along the edges. this opens a larger design space of animated edge textures, featuring additional visual encodings that have potential not only in terms of visual mapping capacity but also playfulness and aesthetics. such animated edge textures have been used in several commercial and design-oriented visualizations, but to our knowledge almost always in a relatively ad hoc manner. we introduce a design space and web-based framework for generating animated edge textures, and report on an initial evaluation of particle properties - particle speed, pattern and frequency - in terms of visual perception.",185
Silicone Devices: A Scalable DIY Approach for Fabricating Self-Contained Multi-Layered Soft Circuits using Microfluidics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656567,"we present a scalable do-it-yourself (diy) fabrication workflow for prototyping highly stretchable yet robust devices using a co2 laser cutter, which we call silicone devices. silicone devices are self-contained and thus embed components for input, output, processing, and power. our approach scales to arbitrary complex devices as it supports techniques to make multi-layered stretchable circuits and buried vias. additionally, high-frequency signals are supported as our circuits consist of liquid metal and are therefore highly conductive and durable. to enable makers and interaction designers to prototype a wide variety of silicone devices, we also contribute a stretchable sensor toolkit, consisting of touch, proximity, sliding, pressure, and strain sensors. we demonstrate the versatility and novel opportunities of our technique by prototyping various samples and exploring their use cases. strain tests report on the reliability of our circuits and preliminary user feedback reports on the user-experience of our workflow by non-engineers.",186
RFIBricks: Interactive Building Blocks Based on RFID,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656568,"we present rfibricks, an interactive building block system based on ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification (rfid) sensing. the system enables geometry resolution based on a simple yet highly generalizable mechanism: an rfid contact switch, which is made by cutting each rfid tag into two parts, namely antenna and chip. a magnetic connector is then coupled with each part. when the antenna and chip connect, an interaction event with an id is transmitted to the reader. on the basis of our design of rfid contact switch patterns, we present a system of interactive physical building blocks that resolves the stacking order and orientation when one block is stacked upon another, determines a three-dimensional (3d) geometry built on a two-dimensional base plate, and detects user inputs by incorporating electromechanical sensors. because it is calibration-free and does not require batteries in each block, it facilitates straightforward maintenance when deployed at scale. compared with other approaches, this rfid-based system resolves several critical challenges in human-computer interaction, such as 1) determining the identity and the built 3d geometry of passive building blocks, 2) enabling stackable token+constraint interaction on a tabletop, and 3) tracking in-hand assembly.",187
Let Me Be Implicit: Using Motive Disposition Theory to Predict and Explain Behaviour in Digital Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656569,"we introduce explicit and implicit motives (i.e., achievement, affiliation, power, autonomy) into player experience research and situate them in existing theories of player motivation, personality, playstyle, and experience. additionally, we conducted an experiment with 109 players in a social play situation and show that: 1. as expected, there are several correlations of playstyle, personality, and motivation with explicit motives, but few with implicit motives; 2. the implicit affiliation motive predicts in-game social behaviour; and 3. the implicit affiliation motive adds significant variance to explain regression models of in-game social behaviours even when we control for social aspects of personality, the explicit affiliation motive, self-esteem, and social player traits. our results support that implicit motives explain additional variance because they access needs that are experienced affectively and pre-consciously, and not through cognitive interpretation necessary for explicit expression and communication, as is the case in any approaches that use self-report.",188
Single or Multiple Conversational Agents?: An Interactional Coherence Comparison,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656560,"chatbots focusing on a narrow domain of expertise are in great rise. as several tasks require multiple expertise, a designer may integrate multiple chatbots in the background or include them as interlocutors in a conversation. we investigated both scenarios by means of a wizard of oz experiment, in which participants talked to chatbots about visiting a destination. we analyzed the conversation content, users' speech, and reported impressions. we found no significant difference between single- and multi-chatbots scenarios. however, even with equivalent conversation structures, users reported more confusion in multi-chatbots interactions and adopted strategies to organize turn-taking. our findings indicate that implementing a meta-chatbot may not be necessary, since similar conversation structures occur when interacting to multiple chatbots, but different interactional aspects must be considered for each scenario.",189
Understanding the Use and Impact of the Zero-Rated Free Basics Platform in South Africa,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656561,"companies are offering zero-rated, or data-charge free internet services to help bring unconnected users online where internet access is less affordable. however, it is unclear whether these services achieve this goal or how they shape internet use. to inform evidence-based policy around and the design of zero-rated services, we show in this paper how mobile users are making use of facebook's controversial free basics platform. we present findings from interviews of 35 free basics users in south africa: current low-income users and non-regular student users. our findings suggest that free basics does shape internet usage, for instance, users spend more time online because of 'free' apps. second, free basics saves users money but adoption of the platform depends on access to other 'free' internet options. finally, most users are confused about how zero-rated services work and what 'free' means. based on our findings, we make recommendations for future work.",190
Cooperating to Compete: the Mutuality of Cooperation and Competition in Boardgame Play,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656562,"this paper examines the complex relationship between competition and cooperation in boardgame play. we understand boardgaming as distributed cognition, where people work together in a shared activity to accomplish the game. although players typically compete against each other, this competition is only possible through ongoing cooperation to negotiate, enact and maintain the rules of play. in this paper, we report on a study of people playing modern boardgames. we analyse how knowledge of the game's state is distributed amongst the players and the game components, and examine the different forms of cooperation and collaboration that occur during play. further, we show how players use the material elements of the game to support articulation work and to improve their awareness and understanding of the game's state. our goal is to examine the coordinative practices that the players use during play and explicate the ways in which these enable competition.",191
A Matter of Control or Safety?: Examining Parental Use of Technical Monitoring Apps on Teens' Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656563,"adoption rates of parental control applications (""apps"") for teens' mobile devices are low, but little is known about the characteristics of parents (or teens) who use these apps. we conducted a web-based survey of 215 parents and their teens (ages 13-17) using two separate logistic regression models (parent and teen) to examine the factors that predicted parental use of technical monitoring apps on their teens' mobile devices. both parent and teen models confirmed that low autonomy granting (e.g., authoritarian) parents were the most likely to use parental control apps. the teen model revealed additional nuance, indicating that teens who were victimized online and had peer problems were more likely to be monitored by their parents. overall, increased parental control was associated with more (not fewer) online risks. we discuss the implications of these findings and provide design recommendations for mobile apps that promote online safety through engaged, instead of restrictive, parenting.",192
CommunityCrit: Inviting the Public to Improve and Evaluate Urban Design Ideas through Micro-Activities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656564,"while urban design affects the public, most people do not have the time or expertise to participate in the process. many online tools solicit public input, yet typically limit interaction to collecting complaints or early-stage ideas. this paper explores how to engage the public in more complex stages of urban design without requiring a significant time commitment. after observing workshops, we designed a system called communitycrit that offers micro-activities to engage communities in elaborating and evaluating urban design ideas. through a four-week deployment, in partnership with a local planning group seeking to redesign a street intersection, communitycrit yielded 352 contributions (around 10 minutes per participant). the planning group reported that communitycrit provided insights on public perspectives and raised awareness for their project, but noted the importance of setting expectations for the process. people appreciated that the system provided a window into the planning process, empowered them to contribute, and supported diverse levels of skills and availability.",193
The Perils of Confounding Factors: How Fitts' Law Experiments can Lead to False Conclusions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656575,"the design of fitts' historical reciprocal tapping experiment gravely confounds index of difficulty id with target distance d: summary statistics for the candidate fitts model and a competing model may appear identical, and the validity of fitts' model for some tasks can be legitimately questioned. we show that the contamination of id by either target distance d or width w is due to the common practices of pooling and averaging data belonging to different distance-width (d,w) pairs for the same id, and taking a geometric progression for values of d and w. we analyze a case study of the validation of fitts' law in eye-gaze movements, where an unfortunate experimental design has misled researchers into believing that eye-gaze movements are not ballistic. we then provide simple guidelines to prevent confounds: practitioners should carefully design the experimental conditions of (d,w), fully distinguish data acquired for different conditions, and put less emphasis on r² scores. we also recommend investigating the use of stochastic sampling for d and w.",194
Utilizing Narrative Grounding to Design Storytelling Gamesfor Creative Foreign Language Production,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656576,"foreign language students must learn to use language creatively to overcome knowledge gaps and keep readers or listeners interested. however, few tools exist to support practicing this skill. therefore, we set out to explore design of storytelling games for practicing creative language use. through an iterative design process, we identified narrative grounding (establishing common ground for collaborative narrative) as key to student engagement and learning. however, designing games for narrative grounding while keeping the game flexible enough to easily accommodate teacher goals is challenging. considering this challenge, we designed a collaborative storytelling game where students help scaffold the narrative and teachers can easily integrate language goals with ""language cards"". in an in-classroom evaluation with 36 students, we show the importance of narrative grounding for learning. qualitative evidence also suggests narrative grounding makes the game more engaging for players. we conclude with discussion of design implications for digital language learning tools.",195
Accessible Maps for the Blind: Comparing 3D Printed Models with Tactile Graphics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656577,"tactile maps are widely used in orientation and mobility (o&m) training for people with blindness and severe vision impairment. commodity 3d printers now offer an alternative way to present accessible graphics, however it is unclear if 3d models offer advantages over tactile equivalents for 2d graphics such as maps. in a controlled study with 16 touch readers, we found that 3d models were preferred, enabled the use of more easily understood icons, facilitated better short term recall and allowed relative height of map elements to be more easily understood. analysis of hand movements revealed the use of novel strategies for systematic scanning of the 3d model and gaining an overview of the map. finally, we explored how 3d printed maps can be augmented with interactive audio labels, replacing less practical braille labels. our findings suggest that 3d printed maps do indeed offer advantages for o&m training.",196
Reactile: Programming Swarm User Interfaces through Direct Physical Manipulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656578,"we explore a new approach to programming swarm user interfaces (swarm ui) by leveraging direct physical manipulation. existing swarm ui applications are written using a robot programming framework: users work on a computer screen and think in terms of low-level controls. in contrast, our approach allows programmers to work in physical space by directly manipulating objects and think in terms of high-level interface design. inspired by current ui programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for swarm ui programming. we propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. to demonstrate these concepts, we developed reactile, a swarm ui programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a dlp projector. two user studies-an in-class survey with 148 students and a lab interview with eight participants-confirm that our approach is intuitive and understandable for programming swarm uis.",197
Increasing User Attention with a Comic-based Policy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657902,"end user license agreements, terms of service agreements and privacy policies all suffer from many of the same problems: people rarely read them and yet still agree to whatever is contained within them. there are many usability challenges with these policies: they are often lengthy, with jargon filled language that is difficult to quickly comprehend. however, these notices are the primary tool for users to understand the privacy implications of their digital activities and make informed decisions on which websites and software they use. prior research has explored alternative designs for such notices, using more visual and structured interfaces for conveying information. we expand upon these results by exploring a comic-based interface, examining whether it can engage users to pay more attention to a terms of service agreement. our results indicate that the comic version did hold user attention for longer than text-based alternatives, encouraging deeper investigation into comic-based interfaces.",198

vrSocial: Toward Immersive Therapeutic VR Systems for Children with Autism,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657916,"social communication frequently includes nuanced nonverbal communication cues, including eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. this type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. specifically, immersive virtual reality (vr) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. in this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive vr. the results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive vr and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. we conclude with design considerations for therapeutic vr systems.",202
DeepWriting: Making Digital Ink Editable via Deep Generative Modeling,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657917,"digital ink promises to combine the flexibility and aesthetics of handwriting and the ability to process, search and edit digital text. character recognition converts handwritten text into a digital representation, albeit at the cost of losing personalized appearance due to the technical difficulties of separating the interwoven components of content and style. in this paper, we propose a novel generative neural network architecture that is capable of disentangling style from content and thus making digital ink editable. our model can synthesize arbitrary text, while giving users control over the visual appearance (style). for example, allowing for style transfer without changing the content, editing of digital ink at the word level and other application scenarios such as spell-checking and correction of handwritten text. we furthermore contribute a new dataset of handwritten text with fine-grained annotations at the character level and report results from an initial user evaluation.",203
Media of Things: Supporting the Production of Metadata Rich Media Through IoT Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657918,"rich metadata is becoming a key part of the broadcast production pipeline. this information can be used to deliver compelling new consumption experiences which are personalized, location-aware, interactive and multi-screen. however, media producers are struggling to generate the metadata required for such experiences, using inefficient post-production solutions which are limited in how much of the original context they can capture. in response, we present media of things (mot), a tool for on-location media productions. mot enables practical and flexible generation of sensor based point-of-capture metadata. we demonstrate how embedded ubiquitous sensing technologies such as the internet of things can be leveraged to produce context rich, time sequenced metadata in a production studio. we reflect on how this workflow can be integrated within the constraints of broadcast production and the possibilities that emerge from access to rich data at the beginning of the production lifecycle to produce well described media for reconfigurable consumption.",204

Examining the Demand for Spam: Who Clicks?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657914,"despite significant advances in automated spam detection, some spam content manages to evade detection and engage users. while the spam supply chain is well understood through previous research, there is little understanding of spam consumers. we focus on the demand side of the spam equation examining what drives users to click on spam via a large-scale analysis of de-identified, aggregated facebook log data (n=600,000). we find (1) that the volume of spam and clicking norms in a users' network are significantly related to individual consumption behavior; (2) that more active users are less likely to click, suggesting that experience and internet skill (weakly correlated with activity level) may create more savvy consumers; and (3) we confirm previous findings about the gender effect in spam consumption, but find this effect largely corresponds to spam topics. our findings provide practical insights to reduce demand for spam content, thereby affecting spam profitability.",210
ColorMod: Recoloring 3D Printed Objects using Photochromic Inks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657925,"recent research has shown how to change the color of existing objects using photochromic materials. these materials can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. the color remains even when the object is removed from the light source. the process is fully reversible allowing users to recolor the object as many times as they want. so far, these systems have been limited to single color changes, i.e. changes from transparent to colored. in this paper, we present colormod, a method to extend this approach to multi-color changes (e.g., red-to-yellow). we accomplish this using a multi-color pattern with one color per voxel across the surface of the object. when recoloring the object, our system locally activates only those voxels that have the desired color and turns all other voxels off. we describe colormod's hardware/software system and its user interface that comes with a conversion tool for 3d printing as well as a painting tool that matches physical voxels with the desired appearance. we also contribute our own material formula for a 3d-printable photochromic ink.",211

A Face Recognition Application for People with Visual Impairments: Understanding Use Beyond the Lab,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657927,"recognizing others is a major challenge for people with visual impairments (vips) and can hinder engagement in social activities. we present accessibility bot, a research prototype bot on facebook messenger, that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and a user's friends' tagged photos on facebook to help people with visual impairments recognize their friends. accessibility bot provides users information about identity and facial expressions and attributes of friends captured by their phone's camera. to guide our design, we interviewed eight vips to understand their challenges and needs in social activities. after designing and implementing the bot, we conducted a diary study with six vips to study its use in everyday life. while most participants found the bot helpful, their experience was undermined by perceived low recognition accuracy, difficulty aiming a camera, and lack of knowledge about the phone's status. we discuss these real-world challenges, identify suitable use cases for accessibility bot, and distill design implications for future face recognition applications.",213
Evaluation Beyond Usability: Validating Sustainable HCI Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657928,"the evaluation of research artefacts is an important step to validate research contributions. sub-disciplines of hci often pursue primary goals other than usability, such as sustainable hci (shci), hci for development, or health and wellbeing. for such disciplines, established evaluation methods are not always appropriate or sufficient, and new conventions for identifying, discussing, and justifying suitable evaluation methods need to be established. in this paper, we revisit the purpose and goals of evaluation in hci and shci, and elicit five key elements that can provide guidance to identifying evaluation methods for shci research. our essay is meant as a starting point for discussing current and improving future evaluation practice in shci; we also believe it holds value for other subdisciplines in hci that encounter similar challenges while evaluating their research.",214
Beyond Translation: Design and Evaluation of an Emotional and Contextual Knowledge Interface for Foreign Language Social Media Posts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657929,"although many social media sites now provide machine translation (mt) for foreign language posts, translation of a post may not suffice to support understanding of, and engagement with, that post. we present sensetrans, a tool that provides emotional and contextual annotations generated by natural language analysis in addition to machine translation. we evaluated sensetrans in a laboratory experiment in which native english speakers browsed five facebook profiles in foreign languages. one group used the sensetrans interface while the other group used mt alone. participants using sensetrans reported significantly greater understanding of the posts, and greater willingness to engage with the posts. however, no additional cognitive load was associated with using an interface that provided more information. these results provide promising support for the idea of using computational tools to annotate communication to support multilingual sense making and interaction on social media.",215
Projective Windows: Bringing Windows in Space to the Fingertip,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657920,"in augmented and virtual reality (ar and vr), there may be many 3d planar windows with 2d texts, images, and videos on them. however, managing the position, orientation, and scale of such a window in an immersive 3d workspace can be difficult. projective windows strategically uses the absolute and apparent sizes of the window at various stages of the interaction to enable the grabbing, moving, scaling, and releasing of the window in one continuous hand gesture. with it, the user can quickly and intuitively manage and interact with windows in space without any controller hardware or dedicated widget. through an evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique is performant and preferable, and that projective geometry plays an important role in the design of spatial user interfaces.",216
Scenariot: Spatially Mapping Smart Things Within Augmented Reality Scenes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657921,"the emerging simultaneous localizing and mapping (slam) based tracking technique allows the mobile ar device spatial awareness of the physical world. still, smart things are not fully supported with the spatial awareness in ar. therefore, we present scenariot, a method that enables instant discovery and localization of the surrounding smart things while also spatially registering them with a slam based mobile ar system. by exploiting the spatial relationships between mobile ar systems and smart things, scenariot fosters in-situ interactions with connected devices. we embed ultra-wide band (uwb) rf units into the ar device and the controllers of the smart things, which allows for measuring the distances between them. with a one-time initial calibration, users localize multiple iot devices and map them within the ar scenes. through a series of experiments and evaluations, we validate the localization accuracy as well as the performance of the enabled spatial aware interactions. further, we demonstrate various use cases through scenariot.",217
AlterWear: Battery-Free Wearable Displays for Opportunistic Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657922,"as the landscape of wearable devices continues to expand, power remains a major issue for adoption, usability, and miniaturization. users are faced with an increasing number of personal devices to manage, charge, and care for. in this work, we argue that power constraints limit the design space of wearable devices. we present alterwear: an architecture for new wearable devices that implement a batteryless design using electromagnetic induction via nfc and bistable e-ink displays. although these displays are active only when in proximity to an nfc-enabled device, this unique combination of hardware enables both quick, dynamic and long-term interactions with persistent visual displays. we demonstrate new wearables enabled through alterwear with dynamic, fashion-forward, and expressive displays across several form factors, and evaluate them in a user study. by forgoing the need for onboard power, alterwear expands the ecosystem of functional and fashionable wearable technologies.",218
The Role of Gamification in Participatory Environmental Sensing: A Study In the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657923,"participatory sensing (ps) and citizen science hold promises for a genuinely interactive and inclusive citizen engagement in meaningful and sustained collection of data about social and environmental phenomena. yet the underlying motivations for public engagement in ps remain still unclear particularly regarding the role of gamification, for which hci research findings are often inconclusive. this paper reports the findings of an experimental study specifically designed to further understand the effects of gamification on citizen engagement. our study involved the development and implementation of two versions (gamified and non-gamified) of a mobile application designed to capture lake ice coverage data in the sub-arctic region. emerging findings indicate a statistically significant effect of gamification on participants' engagement levels in ps. the motivation, approach and results of our study are outlined and implications of the findings for future ps design are reflected.",219
How Information Sharing about Care Recipients by Family Caregivers Impacts Family Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657924,"previous research has shown that tracking technologies have the potential to help family caregivers optimize their coping strategies and improve their relationships with care recipients. in this paper, we explore how sharing the tracked data (i.e., caregiving journals and patient's conditions) with other family caregivers affects home care and family communication. although previous works suggested that family caregivers may benefit from reading the records of others, sharing patients' private information might fuel negative feelings of surveillance and violation of trust for care recipients. to address this research question, we added a sharing feature to the previously developed tracking tool and deployed it for six weeks in the homes of 15 family caregivers who were caring for a depressed family member. our findings show how the sharing feature attracted the attention of care recipients and helped the family caregivers discuss sensitive issues with care recipients.",220
DataInk: Direct and Creative Data-Oriented Drawing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657935,"creating whimsical, personal data visualizations remains a challenge due to a lack of tools that enable for creative visual expression while providing support to bind graphical content to data. many data analysis and visualization creation tools target the quick generation of visual representations, but lack the functionality necessary for graphics design. toolkits and charting libraries offer more expressive power, but require expert programming skills to achieve custom designs. in contrast, sketching affords fluid experimentation with visual shapes and layouts in a free-form manner, but requires one to manually draw every single data point. we aim to bridge the gap between these extremes. we propose dataink, a system supports the creation of expressive data visualizations with rigorous direct manipulation via direct pen and touch input. leveraging our commonly held skills, coupled with a novel graphical user interface, dataink enables direct, fluid, and flexible authoring of creative data visualizations.",221
Remediating a Design Tool: Implications of Digitizing Sticky Notes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657936,"sticky notes are ubiquitous in design processes because of their tangibility and ease of use. yet, they have well-known limitations in professional design processes, as documentation and distribution are cumbersome at best. this paper compares the use of sticky notes in ideation with a remediated digital sticky notes setup. the paper contributes with a nuanced understanding of what happens when remediating a physical design tool into digital space, by emphasizing focus shifts and breakdowns caused by the technology, but also benefits and promises inherent in the digital media. despite users' preference for creating physical notes, handling digital notes on boards was easier and the potential of proper documentation make the digital setup a possible alternative. while the analogy in our remediation supported a transfer of learned handling, the users' experiences across technological setups impact their use and understanding, yielding new concerns regarding cross-device transfer and collaboration.",222
Slacktivists or Activists?: Identity Work in the Virtual Disability March,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657937,"protests are important social forms of activism, but can be inaccessible to people with disabilities. online activism, like the 2017 disability march, has provided alternative venues for involvement in accessible protesting and social movements. in this study, we use identity theory as a lens to understand why and how disabled activists engaged in an online movement, and its impact on their self-concepts. we interviewed 18 disabled activists about their experiences with online protesting during the disability march. respondents' identities (as both disabled individuals and as activists) led them to organize or join the march, evolved alongside the group's actions, and were reprioritized or strained as a result of their involvement. our findings describe the values and limitations of this activism to our respondents, highlight the tensions they perceived about their activist identities, and present opportunities to support further accessibility and identity changes by integrating technology into their activist experiences.",223
Applying Computational Analysis to Textual Data from the Wild: A Feminist Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657938,"with technologies that afford much larger-scale data collection than previously imagined, new ways of processing and interpreting qualitative textual data are required. hci researchers use a range of methods for interpreting the 'full range of human experience' from qualitative data, however, such approaches are not always scalable. feminist geography seeks to explore how diverse and varied accounts of place can be understood and represented, whilst avoiding reductive classification systems. in this paper, we assess the extent to which unsupervised topic models can support such a research agenda. drawing on literature from feminist and critical gis, we present a case study analysis of a volunteered geographic information dataset of reviews about breastfeeding in public spaces. we demonstrate that topic modelling can offer novel insights and nuanced interpretations of complex concepts such as privacy and be integrated into a critically reflexive feminist data analysis approach that captures and represents diverse experiences of place.",224
Design Opportunities for AAC and Children with Severe Speech and Physical Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657939,"augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies can support children with severe speech and physical impairments (sspi) to express themselves. yet, these seemingly 'enabling' technologies are often abandoned by this target group, suggesting a need to understand how they are used in communication. little research has considered the interaction between people, interaction design and the material dimension of aac. to address this, we report on a qualitative video study that examines the situated communication of five children using aac in a special school. our findings offer a new perspective on reconceptualising aac design and use revealing four areas for future design: (1) incorporating an embodied view of communication, (2) designing to emphasise children's competence and agency, (3) regulating the presence, prominence and value of aac, and (4) supporting a wider range of communicative functions that help address children's needs.",225

Digital Payment and Its Discontents: Street Shops and the Indian Government's Push for Cashless Transactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657931,"in november 2016, the government of india banned the vast majority of the nation's banknotes in a move referred to as 'demonetization', with the stated goals of fighting corruption, terrorism, and eventually expanding digital transactions. in this study of 200 shop-keepers in mumbai and bengaluru, we found that cash shortage increased digital payment adoption but that digital payments fell after new banknotes became available. digital payment adoption depended on the nature and scope of transactions, type of product sold, as well as personal factors specific to business owners such as comfort and familiarity with other digital technologies and online transactions. using theoretical work on market and information behavior, we examined environmental pushes for technology adoption against prevalent transactional practices, trust, and control. we propose that the move toward digital payments must be framed within a larger undertaking of technology-driven modernity that drives these initiatives, rather than just the efficiency or productivity gains digital payments present.",227
Moving Target Selection: A Cue Integration Model,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657932,"this paper investigates a common task requiring temporal precision: the selection of a rapidly moving target on display by invoking an input event when it is within some selection window. previous work has explored the relationship between accuracy and precision in this task, but the role of visual cues available to users has remained unexplained. to expand modeling of timing performance to multimodal settings, common in gaming and music, our model builds on the principle of probabilistic cue integration. maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is used to model how different types of cues are integrated into a reliable estimate of the temporal task. the model deals with temporal structure (repetition, rhythm) and the perceivable movement of the target on display. it accurately predicts error rate in a range of realistic tasks. applications include the optimization of difficulty in game-level design.",228
Inferring Loop Invariants through Gamification,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657933,"in today's modern world, bugs in software systems incur significant costs. one promising approach to improve software quality is automated software verification. in this approach, an automated tool tries to prove the software correct once and for all. although significant progress has been made in this direction, there are still many cases where automated tools fail. we focus specifically on one aspect of software verification that has been notoriously hard to automate: inferring loop invariants that are strong enough to enable verification. in this paper, we propose a solution to this problem through gamification and crowdsourcing. in particular, we present a puzzle game where players find loop invariants without being aware of it, and without requiring any expertise on software verification. we show through an experiment with mechanical turk users that players enjoy the game, and are able to solve verification tasks that automated state-of-the-art tools cannot.",229
CrowdLayout: Crowdsourced Design and Evaluation of Biological Network Visualizations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657934,"biologists often perform experiments whose results generate large quantities of data, such as interactions between molecules in a cell, that are best represented as networks (graphs). to visualize these networks and communicate them in publications, biologists must manually position the nodes and edges of each network to reflect their real-world physical structure. this process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. in this paper, we present crowdlayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. crowdlayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. we evaluated crowdlayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts. we also discuss implications for crowdsourced design and network visualizations in other domains.",230
Imaginary Design Workbooks: Constructive Criticism and Practical Provocation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657945,"his paper reports on design strategies for critical and experimental work that remains constructive. we report findings from a design workshop that explored the ""home hub"" space through ""imaginary design workbooks"". these feature ambiguous images and annotations written in an invented language to suggest a design space without specifying any particular idea. many of the concepts and narratives which emerged from the workshop focused on extreme situations: some thoughtful, some dystopian, some even mythic. one of the workshop ideas was then developed with a senior social worker who works with young offenders. a ""digital social worker"" concept was developed and critiqued simultaneously. we draw on foucault's history of surveillance to ""defamiliarise"" both the home hub technology and the current youth justice system. we argue that the dichotomy between ""constructive"" and ""critical"" design is false because design is never neutral.",231
Drunk User Interfaces: Determining Blood Alcohol Level through Everyday Smartphone Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657946,"breathalyzers, the standard quantitative method for assessing inebriation, are primarily owned by law enforcement and used only after a potentially inebriated individual is caught driving. however, not everyone has access to such specialized hardware. we present drunk user interfaces: smartphone user interfaces that measure how alcohol affects a person's motor coordination and cognition using performance metrics and sensor data. we examine five drunk user interfaces and combine them to form the ""dui app"". dui uses machine learning models trained on human performance metrics and sensor data to estimate a person's blood alcohol level (bal). we evaluated dui on 14 individuals in a week-long longitudinal study wherein each participant used dui at various bals. we found that with a global model that accounts for user-specific learning, dui can estimate a person's bal with an absolute mean error of 0.005% ± 0.007% and a pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.96 with breathalyzer measurements.",232
“That Really Pushes My Buttons”: Designing Bullying and Harassment Training for the Workplace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657947,"workplace bullying and harassment have been identified as two of the most concerning silent and unseen occupational hazards of the 21st century. the design of bespoke training addressing domain-specific job roles and relations presents a particular challenge. using the concept of data-in-place where data is understood as being bound and produced by a particular place, this paper describes how locally-situated accounts can be used to engage employees in workplace-specific training seminars. using higher education as a case study, we describe a four-stage design process for future training efforts: (1) in-depth interviews for further understanding of bullying and harassment; (2) design of digital probes for capturing contextual data; (3) probe deployment and subsequent data analysis; (4) data-driven discussion-based seminars. we outline the potential for digital probes in promoting the denormalization of toxic workplace cultures, considerations for novel sensitive data governance models, and the discussion of data-in-place's temporal dimension.",233
Taking into Account Sensory Knowledge: The Case of Geo-techologies for Children with Visual Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657948,"this paper argues for designing geo-technologies supporting non-visual sensory knowledge. sensory knowledge refers to the implicit and explicit knowledge guiding our uses of our senses to understand the world. to support our argument, we build on an 18 months field-study on geography classes for primary school children with visual impairments. our findings show (1) a paradox in the use of non-visual sensory knowledge: described as fundamental to the geography curriculum, it is mostly kept out of school; (2) that accessible geo-technologies in the literature mainly focus on substituting vision with another modality, rather than enabling teachers to build on children's experiences; (3) the importance of the hearing sense in learning about space. we then introduce a probe, a wrist-worn device enabling children to record audio cues during field-trips. by giving importance to children's hearing skills, it modified existing practices and actors' opinions on non-visual sensory knowledge. we conclude by reflecting on design implications, and the role of technologies in valuing diverse ways of understanding the world.",234
Understanding the Uncertainty in 1D Unidirectional Moving Target Selection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657949,"in contrast to the extensive studies on static target pointing, much less formal understanding of moving target acquisition can be found in the hci literature. we designed a set of experiments to identify regularities in 1d unidirectional moving target selection, and found a ternary-gaussian model to be descriptive of the endpoint distribution in such tasks. the shape of the distribution as characterized by μ and σ in the gaussian model were primarily determined by the speed and size of the moving target. the model fits the empirical data well with 0.95 and 0.94 r2 values for μ and σ , respectively. we also demonstrated two extensions of the model, including 1) predicting error rates in moving target selection; and 2) a novel interaction technique to implicitly aid moving target selection. by applying them in a game interface design, we observed good performances in both predicting error rates (e.g., 2.7% mean absolute error) and assisting moving target selection (e.g., 33% or a greater increase in pointing accuracy).",235
Agile 3D Sketching with Air Scaffolding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657940,"hand motion and pen drawing can be intuitive and expressive inputs for professional digital 3d authoring. however, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3d sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3d sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. our new 3d sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. the user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3d shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3d sketching on a tablet device. our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. then, the user sketches 3d ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. a user study shows that our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3d sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone.",236
KeyTime: Super-Accurate Prediction of Stroke Gesture Production Times,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657941,"we introduce keytime, a new technique and accompanying software for predicting the production times of users' stroke gestures articulated on touchscreens. keytime employs the principles and concepts of the kinematic theory, such as lognormal modeling of stroke gestures' velocity profiles, to estimate gesture production times significantly more accurately than existing approaches. our experimental results obtained on several public datasets show that keytime predicts user-independent production times that correlate r=.99 with groundtruth from just one example of a gesture articulation, while delivering an average error in the predicted time magnitude that is 3 to 6 times smaller than that delivered by clc, the best prediction technique up to date. moreover, keytime reports a wide range of useful statistics, such as the trimmed mean, median, standard deviation, and confidence intervals, providing practitioners with unprecedented levels of accuracy and sophistication to characterize their users' a priori time performance with stroke gesture input.",237
Entrepreneurship and the Socio-Technical Chasm in a Lean Economy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657942,"online technologies are increasingly hailed as enablers of entrepreneurship and income generation. recent evidence suggests, however, that even the best such tools disproportionately favor those with pre-existing entrepreneurial advantages. despite intentions, the technology on its own seems far from addressing socio-economic inequalities. using participatory action research, we investigated why this might be, in an intimate, close-up context. over a 1-year period, we--a collaborative team of university researchers and residents of detroit's east side--worked to establish a neighborhood tour whose initial goal was to raise supplementary income and fundraise for community block clubs. we found that in addition to technical requirements, such as communication tools, a range of non-technological efforts is needed to manage projects, build self-efficacy, and otherwise support community participants. our findings widen ackerman's ""socio-technical gap"" for some contexts and offer a counterpoint to overgeneralized claims about well-designed technologies being able to address certain classes of social challenges.",238
VirtualSpace - Overloading Physical Space with Multiple Virtual Reality Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657943,"although virtual reality hardware is now widely available, the uptake of real walking is hindered by the fact that it requires often impractically large amounts of physical space. to address this, we present virtualspace, a novel system that allows overloading multiple users immersed in different vr experiences into the same physical space. virtualspace accomplishes this by containing each user in a subset of the physical space at all times, which we call tiles; app-invoked maneuvers then shuffle tiles and users across the entire physical space. this allows apps to move their users to where their narrative requires them to be while hiding from users that they are confined to a tile. we show how this enables virtualspace to pack four users into 16m2. in our study we found that virtualspace allowed participants to use more space and to feel less confined than in a control condition with static, pre-allocated space.",239
Effects of Socially Stigmatized Crowdfunding Campaigns in Shaping Opinions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657944,"donation-based crowdfunding platforms have an increasing number of campaigns on socially stigmatized topics. these platforms' widespread online reachability and the large flow of monetary donations have the potential to shape individuals' opinions by influencing their perceptions. however, little research has been done to investigate whether these campaigns impact individuals' opinions and how. we conducted an experiment to explore how an attitude-inconsistent campaign on fairness and equality for lgbtiq people influenced participants' opinion on this topic. although all the participants changed their perceived opinions after reading the support for the campaigns, participants opposing equality were less inclined to change their attitude than participants supporting equality. to examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support. participants opposing equality showed less sensitivity to the level of social support, and wanted to donate significantly more money to anti-equality campaigns compared to those who supported equality. results demonstrate the complex role of crowdfunding campaigns in shaping individuals' opinions on stigmatized topics.",240
A Design Framework for Awareness Cues in Distributed Multiplayer Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657055,"in the physical world, teammates develop situation awareness about each other's location, status, and actions through cues such as gaze direction and ambient noise. to support situation awareness, distributed multiplayer games provide awareness cues - information that games automatically make available to players to support cooperative gameplay. the design of awareness cues can be extremely complex, impacting how players experience games and work with teammates. despite the importance of awareness cues, designers have little beyond experiential knowledge to guide their design. in this work, we describe a design framework for awareness cues, providing insight into what information they provide, how they communicate this information, and how design choices can impact play experience. our research, based on a grounded theory analysis of current games, is the first to provide a characterization of awareness cues, providing a palette for game designers to improve design practice and a starting point for deeper research into collaborative play.",241
Empowerment in HCI - A Survey and Framework,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657056,"empowering people through technology is of increasing concern in the hci community. however, there are different interpretations of empowerment, which diverge substantially. the same term thus describes an entire spectrum of research endeavours and goals. this conceptual unclarity hinders the development of a meaningful discourse and exchange. to better understand what empowerment means in our community, we reviewed 54 chi full papers using the terms empower and empowerment. based on our analysis and informed by prior writings on power and empowerment, we construct a framework that serves as a lens to analyze notions of empowerment in current hci research. finally, we discuss the implications of these notions of empowerment on approaches to technology design and offer recommendations for future work. with this analysis, we hope to add structure and terminological clarity to this growing and important facet of hci research.",242
Multiray: Multi-Finger Raycasting for Large Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657057,"we explore and evaluate a multi-finger raycasting design space that we call ""multiray"". each finger projects a ray on to the display, so the user is interacting from a distance using a form of direct input. specifically, we propose techniques, where patterns of ray intersections created by hand postures form 2d geometric shapes to trigger actions and perform direct manipulations that go beyond single-point selections. two formative studies examine characteristics of multi-finger raycasting for different projection methods, shapes, and tasks. based on the results of those investigations, we demonstrate a number of dynamic ui controls and operations that utilise multiray points and shapes.",243
Feel the Movement: Real Motion Influences Responses to Take-over Requests in Highly Automated Vehicles,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657058,"take-over requests (tors) in highly automated vehicles are cues that prompt users to resume control. tors however, are often evaluated in non-moving driving simulators. this ignores the role of motion, an important source of information for users who have their eyes off the road while engaged in non-driving related tasks. we ran a user study in a moving-base driving simulator to investigate the effect of motion on tor responses. we found that with motion, user responses to tors vary depending on the road context where tors are issued. while previous work showed that participants are fast to respond to urgent cues, we show that this is true only when tors are presented on straight roads. urgent cues issued on curved roads elicit slower responses than non-urgent cues on curved roads. our findings indicate that tors should be designed to be aware of road context to accommodate natural user responses.",244
HomeFinder Revisited: Finding Ideal Homes with Reachability-Centric Multi-Criteria Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657059,"finding an ideal home is a difficult and laborious process. one of the most crucial factors in this process is the reachability between the home location and the concerned points of interest, such as places of work and recreational facilities. however, such importance is unrecognized in the extant real estate systems. by characterizing user requirements and analytical tasks in the context of finding ideal homes, we designed reach, a novel visual analytics system that assists people in finding, evaluating, and choosing a home based on multiple criteria, including reachability. in addition, we developed an improved data-driven model for approximating reachability with massive taxi trajectories. this model enables users to interactively integrate their knowledge and preferences to make judicious and informed decisions. we show the improvements in our model by comparing the theoretical complexities with the prior study and demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the proposed system with task-based evaluation.",245
SpaceTokens: Interactive Map Widgets for Location-centric Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657050,"map users often need to interact repetitively with multiple important locations. for example, a traveler may frequently check her hotel or a train station on a map, use them to localize an unknown location, or investigate routes involving them. ironically, these location-centric tasks cannot be performed using locations directly; users must instead pan and zoom the map or use a menu to access locations. we propose spacetokens, interactive widgets that act as clones of locations, and which users can create and place on map edges like virtual whiteboard magnets. spacetokens make location a first-class citizen of map interaction. they empower users to rapidly perform location-centric tasks directly using locations: users can select combinations of on-screen locations and spacetokens to control the map window, or connect them to create routes. participants in a study overwhelmingly preferred a spacetokens prototype over google maps on identical smartphones for the majority of tasks.",246
M3 Gesture Menu: Design and Experimental Analyses of Marking Menus for Touchscreen Mobile Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657051,"despite their learning advantages in theory, marking menus have faced adoption challenges in practice, even on today's touchscreen-based mobile devices. we address these challenges by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple versions of m3 gesture menu (m3), a reimagination of marking menus targeted at mobile interfaces. m3 is defined on a grid rather than in a radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use. our first controlled experiment on expert performance showed m3 was faster and less error-prone by a factor of two than traditional marking menus. a second experiment on learning demonstrated for the first time that users could successfully transition to recall-based execution of a dozen commands after three ten-minute practice sessions with both m3 and multi-stroke marking menu. together, m3, with its demonstrated resolution, learning, and space use benefits, contributes to the design and understanding of menu selection in the mobile-first era of end-user computing.",247
Queer Visibility: Supporting LGBT+ Selective Visibility on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657052,"lgbt+ people adjust the presentation of their gender and sexual identities in response to social pressures, but their level of visibility differs between social media. we interviewed seventeen lgbt+ students at a socially-conservative university to investigate: (1) how do social media affect lgbt+ user experience of managing self presentation; and (2) how do social media affect participation in lgbt+ communities? we develop implications for design to support queering social media. (1) give people abilities to present themselves with selective visibility, enabling choices about privacy and sharing, in contrast with the hci design principle of indiscriminate 'making visible'. that is, enable participants to define their social media identities in their own ways. (2) conduct studies, with a methodology likewise ensures that participants can define their gender and sexual identities in their own ways, rather than according to a predetermined vocabulary.",248
Bento Browser: Complex Mobile Search Without Tabs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657053,"people engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs. these challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended, resumed, and interleaved. rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded interface. the list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a user can track progress on a specific information query. the search query serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask hierarchy. we instantiate this in the bento mobile search system and investigate its effectiveness in three studies. we find converging evidence that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit.",249

Insert Needle Here! A Custom Display for Optimized Biopsy Needle Placement,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657075,"needle-guiding templates are used for a variety of minimally invasive medical interventions. while physically supporting needle placement with a grid of holes, they lack integrated information where needles need to be inserted. physicians must manually determine the correct holes based on the output of planning software - a workflow that is error-prone and lengthy. we address these issues by embedding a display into the template using electroluminescence (el) screen printing. the el display is connected to planning software and illuminates the correct hole. in an empirical evaluation with physicians and researchers from the medical domain, we compare the illuminated against the conventional template as used in magnetic resonance imaging (mri) guided prostate biopsies. our results show that the el display significantly improves task completion time by 51%, task load by 47% and usability by 30%.",261
Automatic Diagnosis of Students' Misconceptions in K-8 Mathematics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657076,"k-8 mathematics students must learn many procedures, such as addition and subtraction. students frequently learn ""buggy' variations of these procedures, which we ideally could identify automatically. this is challenging because there are many possible variations that reflect deep compositions of procedural thought. existing approaches for k-8 math use manually specified variations which do not scale to new math algorithms or previously unseen misconceptions. our system examines students' answers and infers how they incorrectly combine basic skills into complex procedures. we evaluate this approach on data from approximately 300 students. our system replicates 86% of the answers that contain clear systematic mistakes (13%). investigating further, we found 77% at least partially replicate a known misconception, with 53% matching exactly. we also present data from 29 participants showing that our system can demonstrate inferred incorrect procedures to an educator as successfully as a human expert.",262
Defining and Predicting the Localness of Volunteered Geographic Information using Ground Truth Data,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657077,"many applications of geotagged content are predicated on the concept of localness (e.g., local restaurant recommendation, mining social media for local perspectives on an issue). however, definitions of who is a ""local"" in a given area are typically informal and ad-hoc and, as a result, approaches for localness assessment that have been used in the past have not been formally validated. in this paper, we begin the process of addressing these gaps in the literature. specifically, we (1) formalize definitions of ""local"" using themes identified in a 30-paper literature review, (2) develop the first ground truth localness dataset consisting of 132 twitter users and 58,945 place-tagged tweets, and (3) use this dataset to evaluate existing localness assessment approaches. our results provide important methodological guidance to the large body of research and practice that depends on the concept of localness and suggest means by which localness assessment can be improved.",263

Which one is me?: Identifying Oneself on Public Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657099,"while user representations are extensively used on public displays, it remains unclear how well users can recognize their own representation among those of surrounding users. we study the most widely used representations: abstract objects, skeletons, silhouettes and mirrors. in a prestudy (n=12), we identify five strategies that users follow to recognize themselves on public displays. in a second study (n=19), we quantify the users' recognition time and accuracy with respect to each representation type. our findings suggest that there is a significant effect of (1) the representation type, (2) the strategies performed by users, and (3) the combination of both on recognition time and accuracy. we discuss the suitability of each representation for different settings and provide specific recommendations as to how user representations should be applied in multi-user scenarios. these recommendations guide practitioners and researchers in selecting the representation that optimizes the most for the deployment's requirements, and for the user strategies that are feasible in that environment.",285
Analysis and Modeling of Grid Performance on Touchscreen Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657090,"touchscreen mobile devices can afford rich interaction behaviors but they are complex to model. scrollable two-dimensional grids are a common user interface on mobile devices that allow users to access a large number of items on a small screen by direct touch. by analyzing touch input and eye gaze of users during grid interaction, we reveal how multiple performance components come into play in such a task, including navigation, visual search and pointing. these findings inspired us to design a novel predictive model that combines these components for modeling grid tasks. we realized these model components by employing both traditional analytical methods and data-driven machine learning approaches. in addition to showing high accuracy achieved by our model in predicting human performance on a test dataset, we demonstrate how such a model can lead to a significant reduction in interaction time when used in a predictive user interface.",286
Communication Behavior in Embodied Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657091,"embodied virtual reality faithfully renders users' movements onto an avatar in a virtual 3d environment, supporting nuanced nonverbal behavior alongside verbal communication. to investigate communication behavior within this medium, we had 30 dyads complete two tasks using a shared visual workspace: negotiating an apartment layout and placing model furniture on an apartment floor plan. dyads completed both tasks under three different conditions: face-to-face, embodied vr with visible full-body avatars, and no embodiment vr, where the participants shared a virtual space, but had no visible avatars. both subjective measures of users' experiences and detailed annotations of verbal and nonverbal behavior are used to understand how the media impact communication behavior. embodied vr provides a high level of social presence with conversation patterns that are very similar to face-to-face interaction. in contrast, providing only the shared environment was generally found to be lonely and appears to lead to degraded communication.",287

From Scanning Brains to Reading Minds: Talking to Engineers about Brain-Computer Interface,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657035,"we presented software engineers in the san francisco bay area with a working brain-computer interface (bci) to surface the narratives and anxieties around these devices among technical practitioners. despite this group's heterogeneous beliefs about the exact nature of the mind, we find a shared belief that the contents of the mind will someday be ""read' or ""decoded' by machines. our findings help illuminate bci's imagined futures among engineers. we highlight opportunities for researchers to involve themselves preemptively in this nascent space of intimate biosensing devices, suggesting our findings' relevance to long-term futures of privacy and cybersecurity.",321
Crowdsourcing Exercise Plans Aligned with Expert Guidelines and Everyday Constraints,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657036,"exercise plans help people implement behavior change. crowd workers can help create exercise plans for clients, but their work may result in lower quality plans than produced by experts. we built crowdfit, a tool that provides feedback about compliance with exercise guidelines and leverages strengths of crowdsourcing to create plans made by non-experts. we evaluated crowdfit in a comparative study with 46 clients using exercise plans for two weeks. clients received plans from crowd planners using crowdfit, crowd planners without crowdfit, or from expert planners. compared to crowd planners not using crowdfit, crowd planners using crowdfit created plans that are more actionable and more aligned with exercise guidelines. compared to experts, crowd planners created more actionable plans, and plans that are not significantly different with respect to tailoring, strength and aerobic principles. they struggled, however, to satisfy exercise requirements of amount of exercise. we discuss opportunities for designing technology supporting physical activity planning by non-experts.",322
Bottom-Up Imaginaries: The Cultural-Technical Practice of Inventing Regional Advantage through IT R&D,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657037,"recent hci research on social creativity and bottom-up innovation has highlighted how concerted efforts by the government policy and business communities to develop innovation ecosystems are increasingly intertwined with it research and development. we note that many such efforts focus on cultivating regional advantage [20] in the form of innovation hubs that are situated in and leverage distinct sociocultural histories and geographies. cultivating regional advantage entails achieving broad consensus about what that region's advantage might be, that is, the construction of a regional advantage imaginary beyond the policies, it supports, and practices to make it happen. here, we document how an ongoing public debate among makers and manufacturers in taiwan as a region-distinguished by direct engagement with design, fabrication, prototyping, and manufacturing processes-are proposing pathways toward a regional advantage that both reflects taiwan's recent sociocultural and economic histories and also its near future aspirations.",323
Balancing Privacy and Information Disclosure in Interactive Record Linkage with Visual Masking,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657038,"effective use of data involving personal or sensitive information often requires different people to have access to personal information, which significantly reduces the personal privacy of those whose data is stored and increases risk of identity theft, data leaks, or social engineering attacks. our research studies the tradeoffs between privacy and utility of personal information for human decision making. using a record-linkage scenario, this paper presents a controlled study of how varying degrees of information availability influences the ability to effectively use personal information. we compared the quality of human decision-making using a visual interface that controls the amount of personal information available using visual markup to highlight data discrepancies. with this interface, study participants who viewed only 30% of data content had decision quality similar to those who had full 100% access. the results demonstrate that it is possible to greatly limit the amount of personal information available to human decision makers without negatively affecting utility or human effectiveness. however, the findings also show there is a limit to how much data can be hidden before negatively influencing the quality of judgment in decisions involving person-level data. despite the reduced accuracy with extreme data hiding, the study demonstrates that with proper interface designs, many correct decisions can be made with even legally de-identified data that is fully masked (74.5% accuracy with fully-masked data compared to 84.1% with full access). thus, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data access, use of well-designed interface can significantly improve data utility.",324
Streets for People: Engaging Children in Placemaking Through a Socio-technical Process,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657039,"in this paper, we present a socio-technical process designed to engage children in an ongoing urban design project-streets for people-in newcastle, uk. we translated urban design proposals developed by residents and the local authority to enable children to contribute ideas to the project. our process comprised three stages: situated explorations and evidence gathering through digitally supported neighbourhood walks; issue mapping and peer-to-peer discussions using an online engagement platform; and face-to-face dialogue between children, residents, and the local authority through a 'town hall' event. we report insights gained through our engagement and show how our activities facilitated issue advocacy and the development of children's capacities, but also surfaced tensions around the agency of children in political processes. we reflect on the challenges of working in this space, and discuss wider implications for technology design and ethical questions that 'scaling up' such work might pose.",325
Vanishing Importance: Studying Immersive Effects of Game Audio Perception on Player Experiences in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657030,"sound and virtual reality (vr) are two important output modalities for creating an immersive player experience (px). while prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on px in vr. to address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a vr and monitor-display version of the same game on px. subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on px in vr. results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on px in vr because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in vr may not be a significant factor contributing to px. based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for vr games.",326
Flexible Learning with Semantic Visual Exploration and Sequence-Based Recommendation of MOOC Videos,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657031,"massive open online course (mooc) platforms have scaled online education to unprecedented enrollments, but remain limited by their rigid, predetermined curricula. to overcome this limitation, this paper contributes a visual recommender system called moocex. the system recommends lecture videos across different courses by considering both video contents and sequential inter-topic relationships mined from course syllabi; and more importantly, it allows for interactive visual exploration of the semantic space of recommendations within a learner's current context. when compared to traditional methods (e.g., content-based recommendation and ranked list representations), moocex suggests videos from more diverse perspectives and helps learners make better video playback decisions. further, feedback from mooc learners and instructors indicates that the system enhances both learning and teaching effectiveness.",327
“Trust Us”: Mobile Phone Use Patterns Can Predict Individual Trust Propensity,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657032,"an individual's trust propensity - i.e., a dispositional willingness to rely on others"" - mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for their personal, and societal, well-being. hence, understanding and modeling an individual's trust propensity is important for human-centered computing research. conventional methods for understanding trust propensities have been surveys and lab experiments. we propose a new approach to model trust propensity based on long-term phone use metadata that aims to complement typical survey approaches with a lower-cost, faster, and scalable alternative. based on analysis of data from a 10-week field study (mobile phone logs) and ""ground truth"" survey involving 50 participants, we: (1) identify multiple associations between phone-based social behavior and trust propensity; (2) define a machine learning model that automatically infers a person's trust propensity. the results pave way for understanding trust at a societal scale and have implications for personalized applications in the emerging social internet of things.",328

Designing Pronunciation Learning Tools: The Case for Interactivity against Over-Engineering,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657168,"paired role-play is a common collaborative activity in language learning classrooms, adding meaning and cultural context to the learning process. this is complemented by teachers' immediate and explicit feedback. interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. more commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. this limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learners' speech in unconstrained tasks. in this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of french. we found that students' pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. we suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support students' engagement.",354

"Capturing, Representing, and Interacting with Laughter",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657160,"we investigate a speculative future in which we celebrate happiness by capturing laughter and representing it in tangible forms. we explored technologies for capturing naturally occurring laughter as well as various physical representations of it. for several weeks, our participants collected audio samples of everyday conversations with their loved ones. we processed those samples through a machine learning algorithm and shared the resulting tangible representations (e.g., physical containers and edible displays) with our participants. in collecting, listening to, interacting with, and sharing their laughter with loved ones, participants described both joy in preserving and interacting with laughter and tension in collecting it. this study revealed that the tangibility of laughter representations matters, especially its symbolism and material quality. we discuss design implications of giving permanent forms to laughter and consider the sound of laughter as a part of our personal past that we might seek to preserve and reflect upon.",356
Geocaching with a Beam: Shared Outdoor Activities through a Telepresence Robot with 360 Degree Viewing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657161,"people often enjoy sharing outdoor activities together such as walking and hiking. however, when family and friends are separated by distance it can be difficult if not impossible to share such activities. we explore this design space by investigating the benefits and challenges of using a telepresence robot to support outdoor leisure activities. in our study, participants participated in the outdoor activity of geocaching where one person geocached with the help of a remote partner via a telepresence robot. we compared a wide field of view (wfov) camera to a 360° camera. results show the benefits of having a physical embodiment and a sense of immersion with the 360° view. yet challenges related to a lack of environmental awareness, safety issues, and privacy concerns resulting from bystander interactions. these findings illustrate the need to design telepresence robots with the environment and public in mind to provide an enhanced sensory experience while balancing safety and privacy issues resulting from being amongst the general public.",357
PalmTouch: Using the Palm as an Additional Input Modality on Commodity Smartphones,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657162,"touchscreens are the most successful input method for smartphones. despite their flexibility, touch input is limited to the location of taps and gestures. we present palmtouch, an additional input modality that differentiates between touches of fingers and the palm. touching the display with the palm can be a natural gesture since moving the thumb towards the device's top edge implicitly places the palm on the touchscreen. we present different use cases for palmtouch, including the use as a shortcut and for improving reachability. to evaluate these use cases, we have developed a model that differentiates between finger and palm touch with an accuracy of 99.53% in realistic scenarios. results of the evaluation show that participants perceive the input modality as intuitive and natural to perform. moreover, they appreciate palmtouch as an easy and fast solution to address the reachability issue during one-handed smartphone interaction compared to thumb stretching or grip changes.",358
How “Wide Walls” Can Increase Engagement: Evidence From a Natural Experiment in Scratch,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657163,"a core aim for designing constructionist learning systems and toolkits is enabling ""wide walls""-a metaphor used to describe supporting a diverse range of creative outcomes. ensuring that a broad design space is afforded to learners by a toolkit is a common approach to achieving wide walls. we use econometric methods to provide an empirical test of the wide walls theory through a natural experiment in the scratch online community. we estimate the causal effect of a policy change that gave a large number of scratch users access to a more powerful version of scratch data structures, effectively widening the walls for learners. we show that access to and use of these more powerful new data structures caused learners to use data structures more frequently. our findings provide support for the theory that wide walls can increase engagement and learning.",359
Activity Tracking in vivo,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657164,"while recent research has emphasized the importance of understanding the lived experience of personal tracking, very little is known about the everyday coordination between tracker use and the surrounding environment. we combine behavioral data from trackers with video recordings from wearable cameras, in an attempt to understand how usage unfolds in daily life and how it is shaped by the context of use. we recorded twelve participants' daily use of activity trackers, collecting and analyzing 244 incidents where activity trackers were used. among our findings, tracker use was strongly driven by reflection and learning-in action, contrasting the traditional view that learning is one of deep exploration, following the collection of data on behaviors. we leverage on these insights and propose three directions for the design of activity trackers: facilitating learning through glances, providing normative feedback and facilitating micro-plans.",360
Understanding Users' Capability to Transfer Information between Mixed and Virtual Reality: Position Estimation across Modalities and Perspectives,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657175,"mixed reality systems combine physical and digital worlds, with great potential for the future of hci. it is possible to design systems that support flexible degrees of virtuality by combining complementary technologies. in order for such systems to succeed, users must be able to create unified mental models out of heterogeneous representations. in this paper, we present two studies focusing on the users' accuracy on heterogeneous systems using spatial augmented reality (sar) and immersive virtual reality (vr) displays, and combining viewpoints (egocentric and exocentric). the results show robust estimation capabilities across conditions and viewpoints.",361
Seemo: A Computational Approach to See Emotions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657176,"successful human interactions are based on becoming aware of other's emotion and making adaptations accordingly. however, understanding emotion is a complex task that has generated countless debates among researchers over the past decades. the abstract nature of human emotion highlights the need for a new data-driven approach that can better describe and compare across fine-grained emotional states. in this study, we propose seemo, a novel neural embedding framework, which allows us to map human emotions into vector space representations. seemo is trained using twitter data and is evaluated on two fundamental use cases in traditional emotion research: determining the underlying dimensions of emotions and identifying the set of basic emotions. the evaluation reveals that on both tasks seemo can generate results consistent with the mainstream theories. results also show that the vector space representation of seemo can effectively decode the important relationships between emotions that were usually not explicitly presented.",362
"Knowing You, Seeing Me: Investigating User Preferences in Drone-Human Acknowledgement",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657177,"in the past, human proxemics research has poorly predicted human robot interaction distances. this paper presents three studies on drone gestures to acknowledge human presence and clarify suitable acknowledging distances. we evaluated four drone gestures based on non-verbal human greetings. the gestures included orienting towards the counterpart and salutation gestures. we tested these individually and in combination to create a feeling of acknowledgement in people. our users preferred being acknowledged from two meters away but gestures were also effective from four meters. rotating the drone towards the user elicited a higher degree of acknowledgement than without. we conclude with a set design guidelines for drone gestures.",363
Evaluating CoBlox: A Comparative Study of Robotics Programming Environments for Adult Novices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657178,"a new wave of collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans is bringing the automation historically seen in large-scale industrial settings to new, diverse contexts. however, the ability to program these machines often requires years of training, making them inaccessible or impractical for many. this paper rethinks what robot programming interfaces could be in order to make them accessible and intuitive for adult novice programmers. we created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot and conducted a study with 67 adult novices comparing it to two programming approaches in widespread use in industry. the results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction. the contribution of this work is showing the potential for using block-based programming to make powerful technologies accessible to a wider audience.",364
Rolling-Menu: Rapid Command Selection in Toolbars Using Roll Gestures with a Multi-DoF Mouse,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657179,"this paper presents rolling-menu, a technique for selecting toolbar items, based on the use of roll gestures with a multidimensional device, the roly-poly mouse (rpm). rolling-menu reduces object-command transition, resulting in a better integration between command selection and direct manipulation of application objects. selecting a toolbar item with rolling-menu requires rolling rpm in a predefined direction corresponding to the item. we propose a design space of rolling-menu that includes different roll mapping and validation modes. a first user's study, with a simple toolbar containing up to 14 items, establishes that the best version of rolling-menu takes, on average, up to 29% less time than the mouse to select a toolbar item. moreover accuracy of the selection with rolling-menu is above 90%. both the validation mode and the mapping between roll direction and toolbar items influence the performance of rolling-menus. a second study compares the three best versions of rolling-menu with the mouse to select an item in two types of multidimensional toolbars: a toolbar containing dropdown lists, and a grid toolbar. results confirm the advantage of rolling-menu over a mouse.",365
Effects of Enhanced Gaze Presentation on Gaze Leading in Remote Collaborative Physical Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657170,"with respect to collaborative physical tasks, gaze and gestures play significant roles when referring to physical objects. in video-mediated communication, however, such nonverbal cues become ""ineffectual"" when they are presented via a 2d monitor, making video-mediated collaborative physical tasks inefficient. this study focuses on gaze cues to support remote collaborative physical tasks and uses an eye-shaped display, ""thirdeye,"" a simple add-on display that represents a remote participant's gaze direction. thirdeye is expected to be especially effective when used with mobile terminals. we investigated whether the thirdeye's gaze shift is effective in leading a local observer's attention toward objects in the local environment, even when thirdeye is presented with the actual face image of a remote person. experimental results show that thirdeye can lead the local participant's attention to intended objects faster than without thirdeye.",366
Dream Lens: Exploration and Visualization of Large-Scale Generative Design Datasets,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657171,"this paper presents dream lens, an interactive visual analysis tool for exploring and visualizing large-scale generative design datasets. unlike traditional computer aided design, where users create a single model, with generative design, users specify high-level goals and constraints, and the system automatically generates hundreds or thousands of candidates all meeting the design criteria. once a large collection of design variations is created, the designer is left with the task of finding the design, or set of designs, which best meets their requirements. this is a complicated task which could require analyzing the structural characteristics and visual aesthetics of the designs. two studies are conducted which demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the dream lens system, and a generatively designed dataset of 16,800 designs for a sample design problem is described and publicly released to encourage advancement in this area.",367

"Everything We Do, Everything We Press: Data-Driven Remote Performance Management in a Mobile Workplace",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657173,"this paper examines how data-driven performance monitoring technologies affect the work of telecommunications field engineers. as a mobile workforce, this occupational group rely on an array of smartphone applications to plan, manage and report on their jobs, and to liaise remotely with managers and colleagues. these technologies intend to help field engineers be more productive and have greater control over their work; however they also gather data related to the quantity and effectiveness of their labor. we conducted a qualitative study examining engineers' experiences of these systems. our findings suggest they simultaneously enhance worker autonomy, support co-ordination with and monitoring of colleagues, but promote anxieties around productivity and the interpretation of data by management. we discuss the implications of data-driven performance management technologies on worker agency, and examine the consequences of such systems in an era of quantified workplaces.",369
Social Affordances at Play: Game Design Toward Socio-Technical Innovation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657174,"in this paper we propose that game design strategies and theories can be useful tools for supporting the design of innovative socio-technical systems aimed at supporting social co-presence. we support this proposal with an annotated portfolio of a series of research prototype games that investigate sensor affordances and configurations to sustain and enhance social co-presence. we introduce relevant theory from game studies (the magic circle; the mda (mechanics/dynamics/aesthetics framework)) to help ground and guide the use of game design in hci practice. we conclude with recommendations for adopting game design as a supplementary research technique, with caveats about the limits of the approach.",370
A Critical Examination of Feedback in Early Reading Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657185,"learning games now play a role in both formal and informal learning, including foundational skills such as literacy. while feedback is recognised as a key pedagogical dimension of these games, particularly in early learning, there has been no research on how commercial games available to schools and parents reify learning theory into feedback. using a systematic content analysis, we examine how evidence-based feedback principles manifest in five widely-used learning games designed to foster young children's reading skills. our findings highlight strengths in how games deliver feedback when players succeed. many of the games, however, were inconsistent and not proactive when providing error feedback, often promoting trial and error strategies. furthermore, there was a lack of support for learning the game mechanics and a preference for task-oriented rewards less deeply embedded in the gameplay. our research provides a design and research agenda for the inclusion of feedback in early learning games.",371
HCI meets Material Science: A Literature Review of Morphing Materials for the Design of Shape-Changing Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657186,"with the proliferation of flexible displays and the advances in smart materials, it is now possible to create interactive devices that are not only flexible but can reconfigure into any shape on demand. several human computer interaction (hci) and robotics researchers have started designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising, however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to be addressed. on the material science front, we need breakthroughs in stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept devices. on the interactive devices side, we require a deeper appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the human interactive potential. while these challenges are interesting for the respective research fields, we believe that the true power of shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these communities. in this paper we therefore present a review of advances made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within an hci context.",372
Ticket to Talk: Supporting Conversation between Young People and People with Dementia through Digital Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657187,"we explore the role of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions between people with dementia and young people. though meaningful social interaction is integral to quality of life in dementia, initiating conversation with a person with dementia can be challenging, especially for younger people who may lack knowledge of someone's life history. this can be further compounded without a nuanced understanding of the nature of dementia, along with an unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversation. we designed a mobile application - ticket to talk - to support intergenerational interactions by encouraging young people to collect media relevant to individuals with dementia to use in conversations with people with dementia. we evaluated ticket to talk through trials with two families, a care home, and groups of older people. we highlight difficulties in using technologies such as this as a conversational tool, the value of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions, and the potential to positively shape people with dementia's agency in social settings.",373
Falling for Fake News: Investigating the Consumption of News via Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657188,"in the so called 'post-truth' era, characterized by a loss of public trust in various institutions, and the rise of 'fake news' disseminated via the internet and social media, individuals may face uncertainty about the veracity of information available, whether it be satire or malicious hoax. we investigate attitudes to news delivered by social media, and subsequent verification strategies applied, or not applied, by individuals. a survey reveals that two thirds of respondents regularly consumed news via facebook, and that one third had at some point come across fake news that they initially believed to be true. an analysis task involving news presented via facebook reveals a diverse range of judgement forming strategies, with participants relying on personal judgements as to plausibility and scepticism around sources and journalistic style. this reflects a shift away from traditional methods of accessing the news, and highlights the difficulties in combating the spread of fake news.",374
'It's Reducing a Human Being to a Percentage': Perceptions of Justice in Algorithmic Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657189,"data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice. indeed, european law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and cv filtering. we undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.",375

Face Value?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657193,"we are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in ai and conversational agent (ca) technology. given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for cas, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a ca with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. we explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research.",389
Coding Tactile Symbols for Phonemic Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657194,"we present a study to examine one's learning and processing capacity of broadband tactile information, such as that derived from speech. in study 1, we tested a user's capability to recognize tactile locations and movements on the forearm in the presence of masking stimuli and determined 9 distinguishable tactile symbols. we associated these symbols to 9 phonemes using two approaches, random and articulation associations. study 2 showed that novice participants can learn both associations. however, performance for retention, construction of words and knowledge transfer to recognize unlearned words was better with articulation association. in study 3, we trained novel participants to directly recognize words before learning phonemes. our results show that novel users can retain and generalize the knowledge to recognize new words faster when they were directly train on words. finally, study 4 examined optimal presentation rate for the tactile symbols without compromising learning and recognition rate.",390
X-Ray Refine: Supporting the Exploration and Refinement of Information Exposure Resulting from Smartphone Apps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657105,"most smartphone apps collect and share information with various first and third parties; yet, such data collection practices remain largely unbeknownst to, and outside the control of, end-users. in this paper, we seek to understand the potential for tools to help people refine their exposure to third parties, resulting from their app usage. we designed an interactive, focus-plus-context display called x-ray refine (refine) that uses models of over 1 million android apps to visualise a person's exposure profile based on their durations of app use. to support exploration of mitigation strategies, emphrefine can simulate actions such as app usage reduction, removal, and substitution. a lab study of emphrefine found participants achieved a high-level understanding of their exposure, and identified data collection behaviours that violated both their expectations and privacy preferences. participants also devised bespoke strategies to achieve privacy goals, identifying the key barriers to achieving them.",391
Controlling Maximal Voluntary Contraction of the Upper Limb Muscles by Facial Electrical Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657106,"in this paper, we propose to use facial electrical stimulation to control maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) of the upper limbs. the method is based on a body mechanism in which the contraction of the masseter muscles enhances mvc of the limb muscles. facial electrical stimulation is applied to the masseter muscles and the lips. the former is to enhance the mvc by causing involuntary contraction of the masseter muscles, and the latter is to suppress the mvc by interfering with voluntary contraction of the masseter muscles. in a user study, we used electromyography sensors on the upper limbs to evaluate the effects of the facial electrical stimulation on the mvc of the upper limbs. the experimental results show that the mvc was controlled by the facial electrical stimulation. we assume that the proposed method is useful for sports athletes because the mvc is linked to sports performance.",392
How to Design a Digital Storytelling Authoring Tool for Developing Pre-Reading and Pre-Writing Skills,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657107,"in the paper we describe an exploration into the design of an authoring tool to support the creation of multimedia stories. we explicitly targeted children with no reading or writing skills and their educators. children in this age group often enjoy reading and creating stories together with adults and in so doing develop important pre-literacy skills. literature suggests that when children play an active role in these activities, with a high level of engagement and interaction, there is a significant increase in their vocabulary acquisition and an improvement in their communication skills. thus, we investigated these issues by conducting an explorative study in a pre-school class with fifteen children and three teachers. here, we describe the emerging challenges and provide design directions for an authoring system to support the co-creation of stories for pre-literate children.",393
"Non-Native English Speakers Learning Computer Programming: Barriers, Desires, and Design Opportunities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657108,"people from nearly every country are now learning computer programming, yet the majority of programming languages, libraries, documentation, and instructional materials are in english. what barriers do non-native english speakers face when learning from english-based resources? what desires do they have for improving instructional materials? we investigate these questions by deploying a survey to a programming education website and analyzing 840 responses spanning 86 countries and 74 native languages. we found that non-native english speakers faced barriers with reading instructional materials, technical communication, reading and writing code, and simultaneously learning english and programming. they wanted instructional materials to use simplified english without culturally-specific slang, to use more visuals and multimedia, to use more culturally-agnostic code examples, and to embed inline dictionaries. programming also motivated some to learn english better and helped clarify logical thinking about natural languages. based on these findings, we recommend learner-centered design improvements to programming-related instructional resources and tools to make them more accessible to people around the world.",394
The Ambient Birdhouse: An IoT Device to Discover Birds and Engage with Nature,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657109,"we introduce the ambient birdhouse, a novel iot design for the home that seeks to encourage awareness and discovery of birds outside. people increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. the ambient birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. we trialled the ambient birdhouse with five families. key findings are that the playful nature of the birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the birdhouse. learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning.",395
Pocket Skills: A Conversational Mobile Web App To Support Dialectical Behavioral Therapy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657100,"mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. although evidence-based psychotherapy is effective, engagement from such programs can be low. mobile apps have the potential to help engage and support people in their therapy. we developed pocket skills, a mobile web app based on dialectical behavior therapy (dbt). pocket skills teaches dbt via a conversational agent modeled on marsha linehan, who developed dbt. we examined the feasibility of pocket skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. after the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased dbt skills use. we present a model based on qualitative findings of how pocket skills supported dbt. pocket skills helped participants engage in their dbt and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their dbt skills and increase their self-efficacy. we discuss the design implications of these findings for future mobile mental health systems.",396
The Application and Its Consequences for Non-Standard Knowledge Work,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657101,"application-centric computing dominates human-computer interactions, yet the concept of an application is ambiguous and the impact of its ubiquity underexplored. we unpack ""the application"" through the lens of non-standard knowledge work: freelance, self-employed, and fixed-term contract workers who create knowledge in collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders on a per-project basis. based on interviews with fourteen participants we describe how: i) their economic value is intertwined with data and skills related to specific applications; ii) their access to this value is systematically jeopardised in collaboration due to the different application practices, preferences, and proficiencies of other stakeholders; and iii) they mitigate the costs of this compromise through cross-application collaboration strategies. we trace these experiences to common characteristics of applications, such as update processes, interface symmetries, application-document relationships, and operating system and hardware dependencies. by empirically and analytically focusing on ""the application"", we reveal the implications of the current application-centric computing paradigm and discuss how variations within this model create qualitatively different human-computer interactions.",397
Digital Konditorei: Programmable Taste Structures using a Modular Mold,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657102,"digital gastronomy (dg) is a culinary concept that enhances traditional cooking with new hci capabilities, rather than replacing the chef with an autonomous machine. preliminary projects demonstrate implementation of dg via the deployment of digital instruments in a kitchen. here we contribute an alternative solution, demonstrating the use of a modular (silicone) mold and a genetic mold-arrangement algorithm to achieve a variety of shape permutations for a recipe, allowing the control of taste structures in the dish. the mold overcomes the slow production time of 3d food printing, while allowing for a high degree of flexibility in the numerous shapes produced. this flexibility enables us to satisfy chefs' and diners' diverse requirements. we present the mold's logic, arithmetic, design and special parts, the evolutionary algorithm, and a recipe, exploiting a new digital cooking concept of programmable edible taste structures and taste patterns to enrich user interaction with a given recipe.",398
Exploring the Weak Association between Flow Experience and Performance in Virtual Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657103,"many studies conducted in non-virtual activities have shown that flow significantly influences performance, yet studies in virtual activities often reveal only a weak association. this paper begins by building a theoretical explanatory model, and then conducts 3 empirical studies to explore this question. study 1 exams the mechanism of weak association in two virtual activities. study 2 tests the effectiveness of a potential approach to strengthen this association. in study 3 we applied our proposed model and design approach to optimize a vr tennis game. results show that the influence of flow on performance was not significant in those virtual activities where the primary task and the operation of interactive artifacts were less congruent such that the artifacts can lead to flow experience that is independently of the primary task. our research offers a theoretical and empirical basis on how to optimize virtual environment design and maximize positive effect of the flow experience.",399
Understanding the Mundane Nature of Self-care: Ethnographic Accounts of People Living with Parkinson's,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657104,"self-care technologies have been influenced by medical values and models. one of the values that was acritically incorporated was that self-care was medicalised, and, as a result, technologies were designed to afford use with clinicians and fit structured medical processes. this paper seeks to broaden the understanding of self-care in hci, to acknowledge the mundane ways in which self-care is achieved. drawing on in-depth interviews with patients and carers, and online ethnography of an online community, we describe how the self-care of parkinson's is mundane. the fieldwork contrasts with more medicalised perspectives on self-care, thus we discuss the properties of a self-care concept that would acknowledge its mundane nature. our hope is to sensitise designers to identify the mundane ways in which self-care is performed and, consequently, design technologies that better fit the complexities of everyday life with a chronic condition.",400
EDITalk: Towards Designing Eyes-free Interactions for Mobile Word Processing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657115,"we present editalk, a novel voice-based, eyes-free word processing interface. we used a wizard-of-oz elicitation study to investigate the viability of eyes-free word processing in the mobile context and to elicit user requirements for such scenarios. results showed that meta-level operations like highlight and comment, and core operations like insert, delete and replace are desired by users. however, users were challenged by the lack of visual feedback and the cognitive load of remembering text while editing it. we then studied a commercial-grade dictation application and discovered serious limitations that preclude comfortable speak-to-edit interactions. we address these limitations through editalk's closed-loop interaction design, enabling eyes-free operation of both meta-level and core word processing operations in the mobile context. finally, we discuss implications for the design of future mobile, voice-based, eyes-free word processing interface.",401
Improving User Confidence in Concept Maps: Exploring Data Driven Explanations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657116,"automated tools are increasingly being used to generate highly engaging concept maps as an aid to strategic planning and other decision-making tasks. unless stakeholders can understand the principles of the underlying layout process, however, we have found that they lack confidence and are therefore reluctant to use these maps. in this paper, we present a qualitative study exploring the effect on users' confidence of using data-driven explanation mechanisms, by conducting in-depth scenario-based interviews with ten participants. to provide diversity in stimulus and approach we use two explanation mechanisms based on projection and agglomerative layout methods. the themes exposed in our results indicate that the data-driven explanations improved user confidence in several ways, and that process clarity and layout density also affected users' views of the credibility of the concept maps. we discuss how these factors can increase uptake of automated tools and affect user confidence.",402

Make Yourself at Phone: Reimagining Mobile Interaction Architectures With Emergent Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657119,"we present appropriate -- a novel mobile design to allow users to temporarily annex any android device for their own use. appropriate is a small, cheap storage pod, designed to be easily carried in a pocket or hidden within clothing. its purpose is simple: to hold a copy of the local content an owner has on their mobile, liberating them from carrying a phone, or allowing them to use another device that provides advantages over their own. picking up another device when carrying appropriate transfers all pertinent content to the borrowed device (using local no-cost wifi from the appropriate device), transforming it to give the impression that they are using their own phone. while appropriate is useful for a wide range of contexts, the design was envisaged through a co-design process with resource-constrained emergent users in three countries. lab studies and a subsequent deployment on participants' own devices identified key benefits of the approach in these contexts, including for security, resource sharing, and privacy.",405
Interactive Feedforward for Improving Performance and Maintaining Intrinsic Motivation in VR Exergaming,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657110,"exergames commonly use low to moderate intensity exercise protocols. their effectiveness in implementing high intensity protocols remains uncertain. we propose a method for improving performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation in high intensity vr exergaming. our method is based on an interactive adaptation of the feedforward method: a psychophysical training technique achieving rapid improvement in performance by exposing participants to self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. we evaluated our method in a cycling-based exergame. participants competed against (i) a self model which represented their previous speed; (ii) a self model representing their previous speed but increased resistance therefore requiring higher performance to keep up; or (iii) a virtual competitor at the same two levels of performance. we varied participants' awareness of these differences. interactive feedforward led to improved performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation even when participants were aware of the interventions, and was superior to competing against a virtual competitor.",406
ARcadia: A Rapid Prototyping Platform for Real-time Tangible Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657111,"paper-based fabrication techniques offer powerful opportunities to prototype new technological interfaces. typically, paper-based interfaces are either static mockups or require integration with sensors to provide real-time interactivity. the latter can be challenging and expensive, requiring knowledge of electronics, programming, and sensing. but what if computer vision could be combined with prototyping domain-aware programming tools to support the rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces? we designed a toolkit called arcadia that allows for rapid, low-cost prototyping of tuis that only requires access to a webcam, a web browser, and paper. arcadia brings paper prototypes to life through the use of marker based augmented reality (ar). users create mappings between real-world tangible objects and different ui elements. after a crafting and programming phase, all subsequent interactions take place with the tangible objects. we evaluated arcadia in a workshop with 120 teenage girls and found that tangible ar technologies can empower novice technology designers to rapidly construct and iterate on their ideas.",407

Substituting Motion Effects with Vibrotactile Effects for 4D Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657139,"in this paper, we present two methods to substitute motion effects using vibrotactile effects in order to improve the 4d experiences of viewers. this work was motivated by the needs of more affordable 4d systems for individual users. our sensory substitution algorithms convert motion commands to vibrotactile commands to a grid display that uses multiple actuators. while one method is based on the fundamental principle of vestibular feedback, the other method makes use of intuitive visually-based mapping from motion to vibrotactile stimulation. we carried out a user study and could confirm the effectiveness of our substitution methods in improving 4d experiences. to our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the feasibility of replacing motion effects using much simpler and less expensive vibrotactile effects.",425
Communicating Awareness and Intent in Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657130,"drivers use nonverbal cues such as vehicle speed, eye gaze, and hand gestures to communicate awareness and intent to pedestrians. conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. in this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. we conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a segway and a car. we found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.",426
Running Out of Time: The Impact and Value of Flexibility in On-Demand Crowdwork,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657131,"with a seemingly endless stream of tasks, on-demand labor markets appear to offer workers flexibility in when and how much they work. this research argues that platforms afford workers far less flexibility than widely believed. a large part of the ""inflexibility"" comes from tight deadlines imposed on tasks, leaving workers little control over their work schedules. we experimentally examined the impact of offering workers control of their time in on-demand crowdwork. we found that granting higher ""in-task flexibility"" dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of worker behavior and produced a larger amount of work with similar quality. in a second experiment, we measured the compensating differential and found that workers would give up significant compensation to control their time, indicating workers attach substantial value to in-task flexibility. our results suggest that designing tasks which give workers direct control of their time within tasks benefits both buyers and sellers of on-demand crowdwork.",427
Tensions of Data-Driven Reflection: A Case Study of Real-Time Emotional Biosensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657132,"biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.",428
Communicating Algorithmic Process in Online Behavioral Advertising,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657133,"advertisers develop algorithms to select the most relevant advertisements for users. however, the opacity of these algorithms, along with their potential for violating user privacy, has decreased user trust and preference in behavioral advertising. to mitigate this, advertisers have started to communicate algorithmic processes in behavioral advertising. however, how revealing parts of the algorithmic process affects users' perceptions towards ads and platforms is still an open question. to investigate this, we exposed 32 users to why an ad is shown to them, what advertising algorithms infer about them, and how advertisers use this information. users preferred interpretable, non-creepy explanations about why an ad is presented, along with a recognizable link to their identity. we further found that exposing users to their algorithmically-derived attributes led to algorithm disillusionment---users found that advertising algorithms they thought were perfect were far from it. we propose design implications to effectively communicate information about advertising algorithms.",429
Quadcopter-Projected In-Situ Navigation Cues for Improved Location Awareness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657134,"every day people rely on navigation systems when exploring unknown urban areas. many navigation systems use multimodal feedback like visual, auditory or tactile cues. although other systems exist, users mostly rely on a visual navigation using their smartphone. however, a problem with visual navigation systems is that the users have to shift their attention to the navigation system and then map the instructions to the real world. we suggest using in-situ navigation instructions that are presented directly in the environment by augmenting the reality using a projector-quadcopter. through a user study with 16 participants, we show that using in-situ instructions for navigation leads to a significantly higher ability to observe real-world points of interest. further, the participants enjoyed following the projected navigation cues.",430
P2PSTORY: Dataset of Children as Storytellers and Listeners in Peer-to-Peer Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657145,"understanding social-emotional behaviors in storytelling interactions plays a critical role in the development of interactive educational technologies for children. a challenge when designing for such interactions using technology like social robots, virtual agents, and tablets is understanding the social-emotional behaviors pertinent to storytelling-especially when emulating a natural peer-to-peer relation between the child and the technology. we present p2pstory, a dataset of young children (5-6 years old) engaging in natural peer-to-peer storytelling interactions with fellow classmates. the dataset consists of rich social behaviors of children without adult supervision, with each participant demonstrating being a storyteller and a listener. the dataset contains 58 video recorded sessions along with a diverse set of behavioral annotations as well as developmental and demographic profiles of each child participant. we describe the main characteristics of the dataset in addition to findings that reveal perceptual differences between adults and children when evaluating the attentiveness of listeners.",431
Personalizing Persuasive Strategies in Gameful Systems to Gamification User Types,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657146,"persuasive gameful systems are effective tools for motivating behaviour change. research has shown that tailoring these systems to individuals can increase their efficacy; however, there is little knowledge on how to personalize them. we conducted a large-scale study of 543 participants to investigate how different gamification user types responded to ten persuasive strategies depicted in storyboards representing persuasive gameful health systems. our results reveal that people's gamification user types play significant roles in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. people scoring high in the 'player' user type tend to be motivated by competition, comparison, cooperation, and reward while 'disruptors' are likely to be demotivated by punishment, goal-setting, simulation, and self-monitoring. 'socialisers' could be motivated using any of the strategies; they are the most responsive to persuasion overall. finally, we contribute to chi research and practice by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive gameful systems to each gamification user type.",432
Your Eyes Tell: Leveraging Smooth Pursuit for Assessing Cognitive Workload,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657147,"a common objective for context-aware computing systems is to predict how user interfaces impact user performance regarding their cognitive capabilities. existing approaches such as questionnaires or pupil dilation measurements either only allow for subjective assessments or are susceptible to environmental influences and user physiology. we address these challenges by exploiting the fact that cognitive workload influences smooth pursuit eye movements. we compared three trajectories and two speeds under different levels of cognitive workload within a user study (n=20). we found higher deviations of gaze points during smooth pursuit eye movements for specific trajectory types at higher cognitive workload levels. using an svm classifier, we predict cognitive workload through smooth pursuit with an accuracy of 99.5% for distinguishing between low and high workload as well as an accuracy of 88.1% for estimating workload between three levels of difficulty. we discuss implications and present use cases of how cognition-aware systems benefit from inferring cognitive workload in real-time by smooth pursuit eye movements.",433
FingerPing: Recognizing Fine-grained Hand Poses using Active Acoustic On-body Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657148,"fingerping is a novel sensing technique that can recognize various fine-grained hand poses by analyzing acoustic resonance features. a surface-transducer mounted on a thumb ring injects acoustic chirps (20hz to 6,000hz) to the body. four receivers distributed on the wrist and thumb collect the chirps. different hand poses of the hand create distinct paths for the acoustic chirps to travel, creating unique frequency responses at the four receivers. we demonstrate how fingerping can differentiate up to 22 hand poses, including the thumb touching each of the 12 phalanges on the hand as well as 10 american sign language poses. a user study with 16 participants showed that our system can recognize these two sets of poses with an accuracy of 93.77% and 95.64%, respectively. we discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges for the widespread use of this input technique.",434
Frames and Slants in Titles of Visualizations on Controversial Topics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657149,"slanted framing in news article titles induce bias and influence recall. while recent studies found that viewers focus extensively on titles when reading visualizations, the impact of titles in visualization remains underexplored. we study frames in visualization titles, and how the slanted framing of titles and the viewer's pre-existing attitude impact recall, perception of bias, and change of attitude. when asked to compose visualization titles, people used five existing news frames, an open-ended frame, and a statistics frame. we found that the slant of the title influenced the perceived main message of a visualization, with viewers deriving opposing messages from the same visualization. the results did not show any significant effect on attitude change. we highlight the danger of subtle statistics frames and viewers' unwarranted conviction of the neutrality of visualizations. finally, we present a design implication for the generation of visualization titles and one for the viewing of titles.",435
Typing on an Invisible Keyboard,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657140,"a virtual keyboard takes a large portion of precious screen real estate. we have investigated whether an invisible keyboard is a feasible design option, how to support it, and how well it performs. our study showed users could correctly recall relative key positions even when keys were invisible, although with greater absolute errors and overlaps between neighboring keys. our research also showed adapting the spatial model in decoding improved the invisible keyboard performance. this method increased the input speed by 11.5% over simply hiding the keyboard and using the default spatial model. our 3-day multi-session user study showed typing on an invisible keyboard could reach a practical level of performance after only a few sessions of practice: the input speed increased from 31.3 wpm to 37.9 wpm after 20 - 25 minutes practice on each day in 3 days, approaching that of a regular visible keyboard (41.6 wpm). overall, our investigation shows an invisible keyboard with adapted spatial model is a practical and promising interface option for the mobile text entry systems.",436
Fairness and Accountability Design Needs for Algorithmic Support in High-Stakes Public Sector Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657141,"calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithmically-informed public decisions-like taxation, justice, and child protection-are now commonplace. how might designers support such human values? we interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 oecd countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. the results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. we see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. we conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.",437

Social Influences on Executive Functioning in Autism: Design of a Mobile Gaming Platform,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657144,"most studies of executive function (ef) in autism spectrum disorder (asd) focus on cognitive information processing, emphasizing less the social interaction deficits core to asd. we designed a mobile game that uses social and nonsocial stimuli to assess children's ef skills. the game comprised three components involving different ef skills: cognitive flexibility (shifting/inference), inhibitory control, and short-term memory. by recruiting 65 children with and without asd to play the mobile game, we investigated the potential of such platforms for capturing important phenotypic characteristics of individuals with autism. results highlighted between-diagnostic-group differences in playing patterns with children with asd showing broad patterns of ef deficits, but with relative strengths in nonsocial short-term memory, and preserved response to emotional inhibition cues. we showed the system could predict iq, an important target for clinical treatment, towards the goal of developing platforms to act as long-term, efficient, and effective behavioral biomarkers for asd.",440
A Large Inclusive Study of Human Listening Rates,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657255,"as conversational agents and digital assistants become increasingly pervasive, understanding their synthetic speech becomes increasingly important. simultaneously, speech synthesis is becoming more sophisticated and manipulable, providing the opportunity to optimize speech rate to save users time. however, little is known about people's abilities to understand fast speech. in this work, we provide the first large-scale study on human listening rates. run on labinthewild, it used volunteer participants, was screen reader accessible, and measured listening rate by accuracy at answering questions spoken by a screen reader at various rates. our results show that blind and low-vision people, who often rely on audio cues and access text aurally, generally have higher listening rates than sighted people. the findings also suggest a need to expand the range of rates available on personal devices. these results demonstrate the potential for users to learn to listen to faster rates, expanding the possibilities for human-conversational agent interaction.",441
Storyboard-Based Empirical Modeling of Touch Interface Performance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657256,"touch interactions are now ubiquitous, but few tools are available to help designers quickly prototype touch interfaces and predict their performance. for rapid prototyping, most applications only support visual design. for predictive modelling, tools such as cogtool generate performance predictions but do not represent touch actions natively and do not allow exploration of different usage contexts. to combine the benefits of rapid visual design tools with underlying predictive models, we developed the storyboard empirical modelling tool (stem) for exploring and predicting user performance with touch interfaces. stem provides performance models for mainstream touch actions, based on a large corpus of realistic data. we evaluated stem in an experiment and compared its predictions to empirical times for several scenarios. the study showed that our predictions are accurate (within 7% of empirical values on average), and that stem correctly predicted differences between alternative designs. our tool provides new capabilities for exploring and predicting touch performance, even in the early stages of design.",442
Adding Force Feedback to Mixed Reality Experiences and Games using Electrical Muscle Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657257,"we present a mobile system that enhances mixed reality experiences and games with force feedback by means of electrical muscle stimulation (ems). the benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. we demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with ems friction when pushed or an ems-based catapult game. (2) virtual objects augmented via passive props with ems-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with ems-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. we present a user-study in which participants rated the ems-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-ems baseline.",443

Knotation: Exploring and Documenting Choreographic Processes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657259,"contemporary choreographers often interact directly with dancers when exploring their ideas, but lack adequate tools for capturing and documenting their work. although our first study of choreographers and dancers revealed diverse strategies for recording choreographic fragments, we found that they all worked in terms of constraints, which they represented via spatial diagrams, as movement qualities or with their own personal notation system. this led to the design of knotation, a mobile pen-based tool that lets choreographers sketch their own representations of choreographic ideas and render them interactive. in study two, knotation served as a technology probe to support the contrasting practices of three professional choreographers. we revised knotation based on their input, and ran a third structured observation study with six professional choreographers. knotation easily supported both dance-then-record and record-then-dance strategies. participants used and appropriated knotation's advanced features, including the combination of interactive timelines and floorplan diagrams, to represent and explore complex choreographic structures.",445
A Data-Driven Analysis of Workers' Earnings on Amazon Mechanical Turk,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657250,"a growing number of people are working as part of on-line crowd work. crowd work is often thought to be low wage work. however, we know little about the wage distribution in practice and what causes low/high earnings in this setting. we recorded 2,676 workers performing 3.8 million tasks on amazon mechanical turk. our task-level analysis revealed that workers earned a median hourly wage of only ~$2/h, and only 4% earned more than $7.25/h. while the average requester pays more than $11/h, lower-paying requesters post much more work. our wage calculations are influenced by how unpaid work is accounted for, e.g., time spent searching for tasks, working on tasks that are rejected, and working on tasks that are ultimately not submitted. we further explore the characteristics of tasks and working patterns that yield higher hourly wages. our analysis informs platform design and worker tools to create a more positive future for crowd work.",446
Double-sided Printed Tactile Display with Electro Stimuli and Electrostatic Forces and its Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657251,"humans can perceive tactile sensation through multimodal stimuli. to demonstrate realistic pseudo tactile sensation for the users, a tactile display is needed that can provide multiple tactile stimuli. in this paper, we have explicated a novel printed tactile display that can provide both the electrical stimulus and the electrostatic force. the circuit patterns for each stimulus were fabricated by employing the technique of double-sided conductive ink printing. requirements for the fabrication process were analyzed and the durability of the tactile display was evaluated. users' perceptions of a single tactile stimulus and multiple tactile stimuli were also investigated. the obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed tactile display is capable of exhibiting realistic tactile sensation and can be incorporated by various applications such as tactile sensation printing of pictorial illustrations and paintings. furthermore, the proposed hybrid tactile display can contribute to accelerated prototyping and development of new tactile devices.",447

"You Watch, You Give, and You Engage: A Study of Live Streaming Practices in China",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657277,"despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",463
Bolt: Instantaneous Crowdsourcing via Just-in-Time Training,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657278,"real-time crowdsourcing has made it possible to solve problems that are beyond the scope of artificial intelligence (ai) within a matter of seconds, rather than hours or days with traditional crowdsourcing techniques. while this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds---on the order of milliseconds, not seconds---have remained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. we introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instantaneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). the look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. we validate the efficacy and explore the limitations of our approach on the bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (lightning dodger) that we formally model as a markov decision process (mdp). when the mdp reward function is unspecified---as in many real-world tasks---the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (jit) training of the agent's policy function. through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible.",464
Convey: Exploring the Use of a Context View for Chatbots,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657279,"text messaging-based conversational systems, popularly called chatbots, have seen massive growth lately. recent work on evaluating chatbots has found that there exists a mismatch between the chatbot's state of understanding (also called context) and the user's perception of the chatbot's understanding. users found it difficult to use chatbots for complex tasks as the users were uncertain of the chatbots' intelligence level and contextual state. in this work, we propose convey (context view), a window added to the chatbot interface, displaying the conversational context and providing interactions with the context values. we conducted a usability evaluation of convey with 16 participants. participants preferred using chatbot with convey and found it to be easier to use, less mentally demanding, faster, and more intuitive compared to a default chatbot without convey. the paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications offered by convey.",465
Confronting Social Criticisms: Challenges when Adopting Data-Driven Policing Strategies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657270,"proponents of data-driven policing strategies claim that it makes policing organizations more effective, efficient, and accountable and has the potential to address some policing social criticisms (e.g. racial bias, lack of accountability and training). what remains less understood are the challenges when adopting data-driven policing as a response to these criticisms. we present results from a qualitative field study about the adoption of data-driven policing strategies in a midwestern police department in the united states. we identify three key challenges police face with data-driven adoption efforts: data-driven frictions, precarious and inactionable insights, and police metis concerns. we demonstrate the issues that data-driven initiatives create for policing and the open questions police agents face. these findings contribute an empirical account of how policing agents attend to the strengths and limits of big data's knowledge claims. lastly, we present data and design implications for policing.",466

This Changes Sustainable HCI,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657272,"more than a decade into sustainable hci (shci) research, the community is still struggling to converge on a shared understanding of sustainability and hci's role in addressing it. we think this is largely a positive sign, reflective of maturity; yet, lacking a clear set of aims and metrics for sustainability continues to be the community's impediment to progressing, hence we seek to articulate a vision around which the community can productively coalesce. drawing from recent shci publications, we identify commonalities that might form the basis of a shared understanding, and we show that this understanding closely aligns with the authoritative conception of a path to a sustainable future proffered by naomi klein in her book emphthis changes everything. we elaborate a set of contributions that shci is already making that can be unified under klein's narrative, and compare these categories of work to those found in past surveys of the field as evidence of substantive progress in shci.",468
Use the Right Sound for the Right Job: Verbal Commands and Auditory Icons for a Task-Management System Favor Different Information Processes in the Brain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657273,"design recommendations for notifications are typically based on user performance and subjective feedback. in comparison, there has been surprisingly little research on how designed notifications might be processed by the brain for the information they convey. the current study uses eeg/erp methods to evaluate auditory notifications that were designed to cue long-distance truck drivers for task-management and driving conditions, particularly for automated driving scenarios. two experiments separately evaluated naive students and professional truck drivers for their behavioral and brain responses to auditory notifications, which were either auditory icons or verbal commands. our eeg/erp results suggest that verbal commands were more readily recognized by the brain as relevant targets, but that auditory icons were more likely to update contextual working memory. both classes of notifications did not differ on behavioral measures. this suggests that auditory icons ought to be employed for communicating contextual information and verbal commands, for urgent requests.",469
Iris: A Conversational Agent for Complex Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657274,"today, most conversational agents are limited to simple tasks supported by standalone commands, such as getting directions or scheduling an appointment. to support more complex tasks, agents must be able to generalize from and combine the commands they already understand. this paper presents a new approach to designing conversational agents inspired by linguistic theory, where agents can execute complex requests interactively by combining commands through nested conversations. we demonstrate this approach in iris, an agent that can perform open-ended data science tasks such as lexical analysis and predictive modeling. to power iris, we have created a domain-specific language that transforms python functions into combinable automata and regulates their combinations through a type system. running a user study to examine the strengths and limitations of our approach, we find that data scientists completed a modeling task 2.6 times faster with iris than with jupyter notebook.",470
"Explaining Viewers' Emotional, Instrumental, and Financial Support Provision for Live Streamers",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657285,"on live streams, viewers can support streamers through various methods ranging from well-wishing text messages to money. in this study (n=230) we surveyed viewers who had given money to a streamer. we identified six motivations for why they gave money to their favorite live streamer. we then examined how factors related to viewer, streamer, and viewer-streamer interaction were associated with three forms of social support provision: emotional, instrumental, and financial support. our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support. our focus on various types of social support in a live streaming masspersonal platform adds a more detailed understanding to the existing literature of mediated social support. furthermore, it suggests potential directions for designing more supportive and interactive live streaming platforms.",471

Visual ODLs: Co-Designing Patient-Generated Observations of Daily Living to Support Data-Driven Conversations in Pediatric Care,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657287,"teens with complex chronic illnesses have difficulty understanding and articulating symptoms such as pain and emotional distress. yet, symptom communication plays a central role in clinical care and illness management. to understand how design can help overcome these challenges, we created a visual library of 72 sketched illustrations, informed by the observations of daily living framework along with insights from 11 clinician interviews. we utilized our library with storyboarding techniques, free-form sketching, and interviews, in co-design sessions with 13 pairs of chronically-ill teens and their parents. we found that teens depicted symptoms as being interwoven with narratives of personal and social identity. teens and parents were enthusiastic about collaboratively-generated, interactive storyboards as a tracking and communication mechanism, and suggested three ways in which they could aid in communication and coordination with informal and formal caregivers. in this paper, we detail these findings, to guide the design of tools for symptom-tracking and incorporation of patient-generated data into pediatric care.",473
Improving Discoverability and Expert Performance in Force-Sensitive Text Selection for Touch Devices with Mode Gauges,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657288,"text selection on touch devices can be a difficult task for users. letters and words are often too small to select directly, and the enhanced interaction techniques provided by the os -- magnifiers, selection handles, and methods for selecting at the character, word, or sentence level -- often lead to as many usability problems as they solve. the introduction of force-sensitive touchscreens has added another enhancement to text selection (using force for different selection modes); however, these modes are difficult to discover and many users continue to struggle with accurate selection. in this paper we report on an investigation of the design of touch-based and force-based text selection mechanisms, and describe two novel text-selection techniques that provide improved discoverability, enhanced visual feedback, and a higher performance ceiling for experienced users. two evaluations show that one design successfully combined support for novices and experts, was never worse than the standard ios technique, and was preferred by participants.",474
Vibrational Artificial Subtle Expressions: Conveying System's Confidence Level to Users by Means of Smartphone Vibration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657289,"artificial subtle expressions (ases) are machine-like expressions used to convey a system's confidence level to users intuitively. so far, auditory ases using beep sounds, visual ases using leds, and motion ases using robot movements have been implemented and shown to be effective. in this paper, we propose a novel type of ase that uses vibration (vibrational ases). we implemented the vibrational ases on a smartphone and conducted experiments to confirm whether they can convey a system's confidence level to users in the same way as the other types of ases. the results clearly showed that vibrational ases were able to accurately and intuitively convey the designed confidence level to participants, demonstrating that ases can be applied in a variety of applications in real environments.",475
Investigating the Effect of the Multiple Comparisons Problem in Visual Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657280,"the goal of a visualization system is to facilitate dataset-driven insight discovery. but what if the insights are spurious? features or patterns in visualizations can be perceived as relevant insights, even though they may arise from noise. we often compare visualizations to a mental image of what we are interested in: a particular trend, distribution or an unusual pattern. as more visualizations are examined and more comparisons are made, the probability of discovering spurious insights increases. this problem is well-known in statistics as the multiple comparisons problem (mcp) but overlooked in visual analysis. we present a way to evaluate mcp in visualization tools by measuring the accuracy of user reported insights on synthetic datasets with known ground truth labels. in our experiment, over 60% of user insights were false. we show how a confirmatory analysis approach that accounts for all visual comparisons, insights and non-insights, can achieve similar results as one that requires a validation dataset.",476
Passenger Trip Planning using Ride-Sharing Services,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657281,"ride-sharing can potentially address transportation challenges such as traffic congestion and air pollution by letting drivers share their cars unused capacity with a number of passengers. however, even though multiple ride-sharing services exist and hci research has investigated various aspects of their use, we still have limited knowledge on how passengers use ride-sharing services to plan their trips. in this paper, we study how passengers use existing services to support the activity of planning a trip. we report from a qualitative study where we participated in 5 rides and conducted interviews with 19 passengers about their use and opinions towards ride-sharing services. we found that planning a ride involves comparing individual preferences across a number of services which enabled participants to support finding a trip and handle challenges such as privacy and trust. further, we discuss these findings and their implications for future hci research in ride-sharing.",477

Exploring Co-design with Breastfeeding Mothers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657283,"designing mobile applications for breastfeeding mothers can be challenging; creating spaces to foster co-design -- when a mother's primary focus is on her child rather than on design activities - is even more so. in this paper we discuss the development of the milk matters mobile application, a tool developed to motivate women to donate their surplus breast milk to the local milk bank. we look at the importance of different approaches to understanding the mothers, comparing workshops, surveys, and cultural probes. through our work we identify three factors to consider when co-designing with and for mothers: 1) interrupted interactions 2) elements that might distract a baby and 3) the importance of empowering mothers through positive reinforcement. based on these factors we examine our methodological approaches, suggesting ways to make future research with breastfeeding mothers more productive.",479
The Dream is Collapsing: The Experience of Exiting VR,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657284,"research on virtual reality (vr) has studied users' experience of immersion, presence, simulator sickness, and learning effects. however, the momentary experience of exiting vr and transitioning back to the real-world is not well understood. do users become self-conscious of their actions upon exit? are users nervous of their surroundings? using explicitation interviews, we explore the moment of exit from vr across four applications. analysis of the interviews reveals five components of experience: space, control, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. participants described spatial disorientation, for example, regardless of the complexity of the vr scene. participants also described a window across which they exit vr, for example mentally first and then physically. we present six designs for easing or heightening the exit experience, as described by the participants. based on these findings, we further discuss the ?moment of exit' as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced vr experiences.",480
Common Barriers to the Use of Patient-Generated Data Across Clinical Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657295,"patient-generated data, such as data from wearable fitness trackers and smartphone apps, are viewed as a valuable information source towards personalised healthcare. however, studies in specific clinical settings have revealed diverse barriers to their effective use. in this paper, we address the following question: are there barriers prevalent across distinct workflows in clinical settings to using patient-generated data? we conducted a two-part investigation: a literature review of studies identifying such barriers; and interviews with clinical specialists across multiple roles, including emergency care, cardiology, mental health, and general practice. we identify common barriers in a six-stage workflow model of aligning patient and clinician objectives, judging data quality, evaluating data utility, rearranging data into a clinical format, interpreting data, and deciding on a plan or action. this workflow establishes common ground for hci practitioners and researchers to explore solutions to improving the use of patient-generated data in clinical practices.",481
Analyzing the Effect of Avatar Self-Similarity on Men and Women in a Search and Rescue Game,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657296,"a crucial aspect of virtual gaming experiences is the avatar: the player's virtual self-representation. while research has demonstrated benefits to using self-similar avatars in some virtual experiences, such avatars sometimes produce a more negative experience for women. to help researchers and game designers assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of self-similar avatars, we compared players' performance and subjective experience in a search and rescue computer game when using two different photorealistic avatars: their own self or a friend, and when playing either a social (rescuing people) or a nonsocial (rescuing gems) version of the game. there was no effect of avatar appearance on players' performance or subjective experience in either game version, but we also found that women's experience with self-similar avatars was no more negative than men's. our results suggest that avatar appearance may not make a difference to players in certain game contexts.",482
Supporting Rhythm Activities of Deaf Children using Music-Sensory-Substitution Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657297,"rhythm is the first musical concept deaf people learn in music classes. however, hearing loss limits the amount of information that allows a deaf person to evaluate his or her performance and stay in sync with other musicians. in this paper, we investigated how a visual and vibrotactile music-sensory-substitution device, muss-bits++, affects rhythm discrimination, reproduction, and expressivity of deaf people. we conducted a controlled study with 11 deaf children and found that most participants felt more confident wearing the device in vibration mode even when it did not objectively improve their accuracy. furthermore, we studied how muss-bits++ can be used in music classes at deaf schools and what challenges and opportunities arise in such a setting. based on these studies, we discuss insights and future directions that support the design and development of music-sensory-substitution systems for music making.",483

Huggable: The Impact of Embodiment on Promoting Socio-emotional Interactions for Young Pediatric Inpatients,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657206,"most hospitals make efforts to provide socio-emotional support for patients and their families during care. in order to expand the service provided by certified child life specialists, we created a social robot and a virtual avatar that augment part of the care ccls offers to patients by engaging pediatric patients in playful interactions and promoting their socio-emotional wellbeing. we ran a randomized controlled trial in a form of a wizard-of-oz study at a local pediatric hospital to study how three different interactive media (a plush teddy bear, a virtual agent on a screen, and a social robot) influence the pediatric patient's affect, joyful play, and social interactions with others. behavioral analyses of verbal utterance transcriptions and children's physical behavior revealed that the social robot is most effective in producing socially energetic conversations as well as increasing positivity and promoting multi-party interactions. the virtual avatar was socially engaging but children tended to attend more exclusively to a virtual avatar and were less responsive to others. the plush toy was least engaging of the three interventions, but children touched it the most. based on these findings, we recommend use cases for each agent appropriate for individual pediatric patients' health conditions and needs. these analyses of behavioral data suggest the benefit of deploying a physically embodied social robot in pediatric inpatient-care contexts on young patients'; social and emotional wellbeing.",492
Forte: User-Driven Generative Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657207,"low-cost fabrication machines (e.g., 3d printers) offer the promise of creating custom-designed objects by a range of users. to maximize performance, generative design methods such as topology optimization can automatically optimize properties of a design based on high-level specifications. though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas--often unintuitively--to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. we present forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2d topology optimization. users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. users can globally control how much to 'deviate' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.",493
PolarTrack: Optical Outside-In Device Tracking that Exploits Display Polarization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657208,"polartrack is a novel camera-based approach to detecting and tracking mobile devices inside the capture volume. in polartrack, a polarization filter continuously rotates in front of an off-the-shelf color camera, which causes the displays of observed devices to periodically blink in the camera feed. the periodic blinking results from the physical characteristics of current displays, which shine polarized light either through an lc overlay to produce images or through a polarizer to reduce light reflections on oled displays. polartrack runs a simple detection algorithm on the camera feed to segment displays and track their locations and orientations, which makes polartrack particularly suitable as a tracking system for cross-device interaction with mobile devices. our evaluation of polartrack's tracking quality and comparison with state-of-the-art camera-based multi-device tracking showed a better tracking accuracy and precision with similar tracking reliability. polartrack works as standalone multi-device tracking but is also compatible with existing camera-based tracking systems and can complement them to compensate for their limitations.",494

HapCube: A Wearable Tactile Device to Provide Tangential and Normal Pseudo-Force Feedback on a Fingertip,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657202,"haptic devices allow a more immersive experience with virtual and augmented reality. however, for a wider range of usage they need to be miniaturized while maintaining the quality of haptic feedback. in this study, we used two kinds of human sensory illusion of vibration. the first illusion involves creating a virtual force (pulling sensation) using asymmetric vibration, and the second involves imparting compliances of complex stress-strain curves (i.e. force-displacement curves of mechanical keyboards) to a rigid object by changing the frequency and amplitude of vibration. using these two illusions, we developed a wearable tactile device named hapcube, consisting of three orthogonal voicecoil actuators. four measurement tests and four user tests confirmed that 1) a combination of two orthogonal asymmetric vibrations could provide a 2d virtual force in any tangential directions on a finger pad, and 2) a single voicecoil actuator produced pseudo-force feedback of the complex compliance curves in the normal direction.",498
Keppi: A Tangible User Interface for Self-Reporting Pain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657203,"motivated by the need to support those managing chronic pain, we report on the iterative design, development, and evaluation of keppi, a novel pressure-based tangible user interface (tui) for the self-report of pain intensity. in-lab studies with 28 participants found individuals were able to use keppi to reliably report low, medium, and high pain as well as map squeeze pressure to pain level. based on insights from these evaluations, we ultimately created a wearable version of keppi with multiple form factors, including a necklace, bracelet, and keychain. interviews indicated high receptivity to the wearable design, which satisfied additional user-identified needs (e.g., discreet and convenient) and highlighted key directions for the continued refinement of tangible devices for pain assessment.",499
"Data, Data Everywhere, and Still Too Hard to Link: Insights from User Interactions with Diabetes Apps",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657204,"for those with chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, smartphone apps offer the promise of an affordable, convenient, and personalized disease management tool. however, despite significant academic research and commercial development in this area, diabetes apps still show low adoption rates and underwhelming clinical outcomes. through user-interaction sessions with 16 people with type 1 diabetes, we provide evidence that commonly used interfaces for diabetes self-management apps, while providing certain benefits, can fail to explicitly address the cognitive and emotional requirements of users. from analysis of these sessions with eight such user interface designs, we report on user requirements, as well as interface benefits, limitations, and then discuss the implications of these findings. finally, with the goal of improving these apps, we identify 3 questions for designers, and review for each in turn: current shortcomings, relevant approaches, exposed challenges, and potential solutions.",500
Rewire: Interface Design Assistance from Examples,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657215,"interface designers often use screenshot images of example designs as building blocks for new designs. since images are unstructured and hard to edit, designers typically reconstruct screenshots with vector graphics tools in order to reuse or edit parts of the design. unfortunately, this reconstruction process is tedious and slow. we present rewire, an interactive system that helps designers leverage example screenshots. rewire automatically infers a vector representation of screenshots where each ui component is a separate object with editable shape and style properties. based on this representation, the system provides three design assistance modes that help designers reuse or redraw components of the example design. the results from our quantitative and user evaluations demonstrate that rewire can generate accurate vector representations of interface screenshots found in the wild and that design assistance enables users to reconstruct and edit example designs more efficiently compared to a baseline design tool.",501
Uncertainty Visualization Influences how Humans Aggregate Discrepant Information,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657216,"the number of sensors in our surroundings that provide the same information steadily increases. since sensing is prone to errors, sensors may disagree. for example, a gps-based tracker on the phone and a sensor on the bike wheel may provide discrepant estimates on traveled distance. this poses a user dilemma, namely how to reconcile the conflicting information into one estimate. we investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users' inference. we tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty. our study repeatedly presented two sensor measurements with varying degrees of inconsistency to participants who indicated their best guess of the ""true"" value. we found that uncertainty information improves users' estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations. based on our findings, we provide an interactive tool to select the optimal visualization for displaying conflicting information.",502

Is it Happy?: Behavioural and Narrative Frame Complexity Impact Perceptions of a Simple Furry Robot's Emotions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657210,"critical to social human-robot interaction is a robot's emotional richness, expressed within the parameters of its physical display. while emotion arousal is straightforward to convey, human valence (positivity) evaluations are famously ambiguous, whether we are assessing other humans or a robot. imagine someone breathing raggedly: are they nervous, or excited? to assess the premise that irregular breathing connotes low valence (emotion negativity), we implemented different levels of breathing variability and complexity in simple furry robots. we asked 10 participants to watch and feel the behaviors, rate their valence, and explain their impressions. while a quantitative exploration of new and previous data showed correlation between multi-scale entropy and valence, the rich narratives revealed by thematic analysis of participant explanations call into question whether a single motion can, alone, be unambiguously valenced. based on this evidence that people perceive robots as having inner lives, we recommend ways to build up narrative contexts over multiple interactions.",506
Designing a Reclamation of Body and Health: Cancer Survivor Tattoos as Coping Ritual,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657211,"historically, tattoos have been perceived as a mark of deviant behavior from the perspective of western medicine. however, cancer survivor tattoos are one of many strategies used to recover from the trauma of cancer diagnosis and treatment. in this study, we seek to understand the significance of these tattoos in the context of survivorship. we interviewed 19 cancer survivors about their survivor tattoos, exploring the benefits of designing, discussing, and displaying these tattoos as elements of emotional recovery post-cancer. we found that the act of designing a survivor tattoo facilitated all three elements of post-traumatic growth processes, including: (1) changed self-perception; (2) changed sense of relationships with others; and (3) changed philosophy of life. through participants' lived experiences, we discuss information about emotions, health, and recovery encoded in tattoos, and provide implications for tools to help future cancer survivors recover from the trauma of diagnosis and treatment.",507
Mismatch of Expectations: How Modern Learning Resources Fail Conversational Programmers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657212,"conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.",508
An Experience Sampling Study of User Reactions to Browser Warnings in the Field,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657213,"web browser warnings should help protect people from malware, phishing, and network attacks. adhering to warnings keeps people safer online. recent improvements in warning design have raised adherence rates, but they could still be higher. and prior work suggests many people still do not understand them. thus, two challenges remain: increasing both comprehension and adherence rates. to dig deeper into user decision making and comprehension of warnings, we performed an experience sampling study of web browser security warnings, which involved surveying over 6,000 chrome and firefox users in situ to gather reasons for adhering or not to real warnings. we find these reasons are many and vary with context. contrary to older prior work, we do not find a single dominant failure in modern warning design---like habituation---that prevents effective decisions. we conclude that further improvements to warnings will require solving a range of smaller contextual misunderstandings.",509

The Dark (Patterns) Side of UX Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657245,"interest in critical scholarship that engages with the complexity of user experience (ux) practice is rapidly expanding, yet the vocabulary for describing and assessing criticality in practice is currently lacking. in this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a specific ethical phenomenon known as ""dark patterns,"" where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. we assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identified dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. this analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conflated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that ux designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. we conclude with implications for the education and practice of ux designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.",531
Charrette: Supporting In-Person Discussions around Iterations in User Interface Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657246,"as a rule, user interface designers work iteratively. over the course of a project, they repeatedly gather feedback, typically through in-person meetings, and update their designs accordingly. through formative work, we find that design software tools do not support designers in managing meeting notes and previous design iterations as a cohesive whole. this causes designers to rely on ad-hoc practices for organizing work, which makes it hard for them to keep track of relevant feedback and explain their design decisions. to address this problem, we present charrette, a system that allows designers to curate design iterations, attach meeting notes to the relevant content, and navigate sequences of design iterations with the associated notes to facilitate in-person discussions. in an exploratory user study, we evaluate how charrette affects designers' self-reported ease in handling feedback during face-to-face discussions, compared with using their own tools. we find that using charrette correlates with increased confidence and recall in discussing previous design decisions.",532

This App Would Like to Use Your Current Location to Better Serve You: Importance of User Assent and System Transparency in Personalized Mobile Services,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657248,"modern mobile apps aim to provide personalized services without appearing intrusive. a common strategy is to let the user initiate the service request (e.g., ""click here to receive coupons for your favorite products""), a practice known as ?overt personalization."" another strategy is to assuage users' privacy concerns by being transparent about how their data would be collected, utilized and stored. to test these two strategies, we conducted a 2 (personalization: overt vs. covert) x 2 (transparency: high vs. low) factorial experiment, with a fifth control condition. participants (n=302) interacted with greenbyme, a prototype of an eco-friendly mobile application. data show that overt personalization affects perceived control. significant three-way interactions between power usage, perceived overt personalization and perceived information transparency was seen on perceived ease of use, trust in the app, user engagement and behavioral intention to use the app in the future. in addition, results reveal that perceived information transparency also promotes trust, which is negatively linked with privacy concerns and positively correlated with user engagement and product involvement.",534
Pictures Worth a Thousand Words: Reflections on Visualizing Personal Blood Glucose Forecasts for Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657249,"type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a common chronic condition that requires management of one's lifestyle, including nutrition. critically, patients often lack a clear understanding of how everyday meals impact their blood glucose. new predictive analytics approaches can provide personalized mealtime blood glucose forecasts. while communicating forecasts can be challenging, effective strategies for doing so remain little explored. in this study, we conducted focus groups with 13 participants to identify approaches to visualizing personalized blood glucose forecasts that can promote diabetes self-management and understand key styles and visual features that resonate with individuals with diabetes. focus groups demonstrated that individuals rely on simple heuristics and tend to take a reactive approach to their health and nutrition management. further, the study highlighted the need for simple and explicit, yet information-rich design. effective visualizations were found to utilize common metaphors alongside words, numbers, and colors to convey a sense of authority and encourage action and learning.",535
Pac-Many: Movement Behavior when Playing Collaborative and Competitive Games on Large Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657240,"previous work has shown that large high resolution displays (lhrds) can enhance collaboration between users. as lhrds allow free movement in front of the screen, an understanding of movement behavior is required to build successful interfaces for these devices. this paper presents pac-many; a multiplayer version of the classical computer game pac-man to study group dynamics when using lhrds. we utilized smartphones as game controllers to enable free movement while playing the game. in a lab study, using a 4m × 1m lhrd, 24 participants (12 pairs) played pac-many in collaborative and competitive conditions. the results show that players in the collaborative condition divided screen space evenly. in contrast, competing players stood closer together to avoid benefits for the other player. we discuss how the nature of the task is important when designing and analyzing collaborative interfaces for lhrds. our work shows how to account for the spatial aspects of interaction with lhrds to build immersive experiences.",536
BebeCODE: Collaborative Child Development Tracking System,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657241,"continuous tracking young children's development is important for parents because early detection of developmental delay can lead to better treatment through early intervention. screening tests, often based on questions answered by a parent, are used to assess children's development, but responses from only one parent can be subjective and even inaccurate due to limited memory and observations. in this work, we propose a collaborative child development tracking system, where screening test responses are collected through collaboration between parents or caregivers. we implement bebecode, a mobile system that encourages parents to independently answer all developmental questions for a given age and resolve disagreements through chatting, image/video sharing, or asking a third person. a 4-week deployment study of bebecode with 12 families found that parents had approximately 22% disagreements about questions regarding their children's developmental and bebecode helped them reach a consensus. parents also reported that their awareness of their child's development, increased with bebecode.",537
Beyond the Libet Clock: Modality Variants for Agency Measurements,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657242,"the sense of agency (soa) refers to our capability to control our own actions and influence the world around us. recent research in hci has been investigating soa to provide users an instinctive sense of ""i did that"" as opposed to ""the system did that"". however, current agency measurements are limited. the intentional binding (ib) paradigm provides an implicit measure of the soa, however, it is constrained by requiring high visual attention to a ""libet clock"" on-screen. in this paper, we extended the timing stimuli through auditory and tactile cues. our results demonstrate that audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile cues on the hand, are an effective alternative measure of the soa using the ib paradigm. they both address current limitations of the traditional method such as visual attention overload and lack of engagement. we discuss how our results can be applied to measure soa in tasks involving different interactive scenarios such as in mixed/virtual reality.",538
PokeRing: Notifications by Poking Around the Finger,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657243,"smart-rings are ideal for subtle and always-available haptic notifications due to their direct contact with the skin. previous researchers have highlighted the feasibility of haptic technology in smart-rings and their promise in delivering noticeable stimulations by poking a limited set of planar locations on the finger. however, the full potential of poking as a mechanism to deliver richer and more expressive information on the finger is overlooked. with three studies and a total of 76 participants, we informed the design of pokering, a smart-ring capable of delivering information via stimulating eight different locations around the index finger's proximal phalanx. we report our evaluation of the performance of pokering in semi-realistic wearable conditions, (standing and walking), and its effective usage for information transfer with twenty-one spatio-temporal patterns designed by six interaction designers in a workshop. finally, we present three applications that exploit pokering's notification usages.",539

“I Hear You”: Understanding Awareness Information Exchange in an Audio-only Workspace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657357,"graphical displays are a typical means for conveying awareness information in groupware systems to help users track joint activities, but are not ideal when vision is constrained. understanding how people maintain awareness through non-visual means is crucial for designing effective alternatives for supporting awareness in such situations. we present a lab study simulating an extreme scenario where 32 pairs of participants use an audio-only tool to edit shared audio menus. our aim is to characterise collaboration in this audio-only space in order to identify whether and how, by itself, audio can mediate collaboration. our findings show that the means for audio delivery and choice of working styles in this space influence types and patterns of awareness information exchange. we thus highlight the need to accommodate different working styles when designing audio support for awareness, and extend previous research by identifying types of awareness information to convey in response to group work dynamics.",543
User-Driven Design Principles for Gesture Representations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657358,"many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions.",544
To Put That in Perspective: Generating Analogies that Make Numbers Easier to Understand,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657359,"laypeople are frequently exposed to unfamiliar numbers published by journalists, social media users, and algorithms. these figures can be difficult for readers to comprehend, especially when they are extreme in magnitude or contain unfamiliar units. prior work has shown that adding ""perspective sentences"" that employ ratios, ranks, and unit changes to such measurements can improve people's ability to understand unfamiliar numbers (e.g., ""695,000 square kilometers is about the size of texas""). however, there are many ways to provide context for a measurement. in this paper we systematically test what factors influence the quality of perspective sentences through randomized experiments involving over 1,000 participants. we develop a statistical model for generating perspectives and test it against several alternatives, finding beneficial effects of perspectives on comprehension that persist for six weeks. we conclude by discussing future work in deploying and testing perspectives at scale.",545

Supporting Communication between Grandparents and Grandchildren through Tangible Storytelling Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657351,"grandparents and grandchildren that live apart often rely on communication technologies, such as messengers, video conferencing, and phone calls for maintaining relationships. while some of these systems are challenging for grandparents, others are less engaging for children. to facilitate communication, we developed storybox, a tangible device that allows sharing photos, tangible artifacts, and audio recordings of everyday life. we conducted a preliminary study with two families to identify design issues, and further refine the prototype. subsequently, we conducted a field study with four families for up to four weeks to better understand real-world use and examine inter-generational connectedness. we found that storybox was accessible, simple, and helped bridge the technological gap between grandparents and grandchildren. children communicated asynchronously in a playful and idiosyncratic manner, and grandparents shared past family memories. we provide insights on how to ease communication between different generations, engage them in sharing activities, and strengthen family relationships.",547
Tangible Tens: Evaluating a Training of Basic Numerical Competencies with an Interactive Tabletop,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657352,"basic numerical competencies developed in kindergarten form the foundations of math achievement. this indicates the importance of early interventions in the case of numerical difficulties. building on research on math manipulatives and tangible interfaces, we developed a training of basic numerical competencies using an interactive tabletop in combination with physical lego-like blocks. in an experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of the training on children's learning of the partner number concept, basic numerical competencies and number line estimation, compared to a content-wise similar training with physical manipulatives and a human tutor. we observed significant increases in children's understanding of the partner number concept and basic numerical competencies in both training conditions, but no differential training effects. as children can play on the interactive surface with reasonable autonomy, it seems to provide a low threshold possibility to enrich kindergarten education on numerical concepts.",548
"'You Can Always Do Better!"": The Impact of Social Proof on Participant Response Bias",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657353,"evaluations of technological artifacts in hci4d contexts are known to suffer from high levels of participant response bias---where participants only provide positive feedback that they think will please the researcher. this paper describes a practical, low-cost intervention that uses the concept of social proof to influence participant response bias and successfully elicit critical feedback from study participants. we subtly exposed participants to feedback that they perceived to be provided by people 'like them', and experimentally controlled the tone and content of the feedback to provide either positive, negative, or no social proof. we then measured how participants' quantitative and qualitative evaluations of an hci artifact changed based on the feedback to which they were exposed. we conducted two controlled experiments: an online experiment with 245 mturk workers and a field experiment with 63 women in rural india. our findings reveal significant differences between participants in the positive, negative, and no social proof conditions, both online and in the field. participants in the negative condition provided lower ratings and a greater amount of critical feedback, while participants in the positive condition provided higher ratings and a greater amount of positive feedback. taken together, our findings demonstrate that social proof is a practical and generalizable technique that could be used by hci researchers to influence participant response bias in a wide range of contexts and domains.",549
Teaching Language to Deaf Infants with a Robot and a Virtual Human,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657354,"children with insufficient exposure to language during critical developmental periods in infancy are at risk for cognitive, language, and social deficits [55]. this is especially difficult for deaf infants, as more than 90% are born to hearing parents with little sign language experience [48]. we created an integrated multi-agent system involving a robot and virtual human designed to augment language exposure for 6-12 month old infants. human-machine design for infants is challenging, as most screen-based media are unlikely to support learning in [33]. while presently, robots are incapable of the dexterity and expressiveness required for signing, even if it existed, developmental questions remain about the capacity for language from artificial agents to engage infants. here we engineered the robot and avatar to provide visual language to effect socially contingent human conversational exchange. we demonstrate the successful engagement of our technology through case studies of deaf and hearing infants.",550

Printed Paper Actuator: A Low-cost Reversible Actuation and Sensing Method for Shape Changing Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657370,"we present a printed paper actuator as a low cost, reversible and electrical actuation and sensing method. this is a novel but easily accessible enabling technology that expands upon the library of actuation-sensing materials in hci. by integrating three physical phenomena, including the bilayer bending actuation, the shape memory effect of the thermoplastic and the current-driven joule heating via conductive printing filament, we developed the actuator by simply printing a single layer conductive polylactide (pla) on a piece of copy paper via a desktop fused deposition modeling (fdm) 3d printer. this paper describes the fabrication process, the material mechanism, and the transformation primitives, followed by the electronic sensing and control methods. a software tool that assists the design, simulation and printing toolpath generation is introduced. finally, we explored applications under four contexts: robotics, interactive art, entertainment and home environment.",566
Leveraging Semantic Transformation to Investigate Password Habits and Their Causes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657371,"it is no secret that users have difficulty choosing and remembering strong passwords, especially when asked to choose different passwords across different accounts. while research has shed light on password weaknesses and reuse, less is known about user motivations for following bad password practices. understanding these motivations can help us design better interventions that work with the habits of users and not against them. we present a comprehensive user study in which we both collect and analyze users' real passwords and the reasoning behind their password habits. this enables us to contrast the users' actual behaviors with their intentions. we find that user intent often mismatches practice, and that this, coupled with some misconceptions and convenience, fosters bad password habits. our work is the first to show the discrepancy between user intent and practice when creating passwords, and to investigate how users trade off security for memorability.",567
Impact Activation Improves Rapid Button Pressing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657372,"the activation point of a button is defined as the depth at which it invokes a make signal. regular buttons are activated during the downward stroke, which occurs within the first 20 ms of a press. the remaining portion, which can be as long as 80 ms, has not been examined for button activation for reason of mechanical limitations. the paper presents a technique and empirical evidence for an activation technique called impact activation, where the button is activated at its maximal impact point. we argue that this technique is advantageous particularly in rapid, repetitive button pressing, which is common in gaming and music applications. we report on a study of rapid button pressing, wherein users' timing accuracy improved significantly with use of impact activation. the technique can be implemented for modern push-buttons and capacitive sensors that generate a continuous signal.",568
MindNavigator: Exploring the Stress and Self-Interventions for Mental Wellness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657373,"mental wellness is a desirable health outcome for students. however, current personal informatics systems do not adequately support students in creating concrete mental health-related goals and turning them into actionable plans. in this paper, we introduce mindnavigator - a workshop in which groups of college students were invited to generate behavioral change goals to manage daily life stress and practice personalized interventions for two weeks. we describe the manner in which participants identified both stressors and pleasures to create actionable, engaging, and open-ended behavioral plans that aided in stress relief. we found that the social nature of the workshop helped participants understand themselves and execute self-intervention in new ways. through this practice, we build on prior studies to propose an analytical framework of personal informatics for mental wellness.",569

Using Co-Design to Examine How Children Conceptualize Intelligent Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657386,"prior work has shown that intelligent user interfaces (iuis) that use modalities such as speech, gesture, and writing pose challenges for children due to their developing cognitive and motor skills. research has focused on improving recognition and accuracy by accommodating children's specific interaction behaviors. understanding children's expectations of iuis is also important to decrease the impact of recognition errors that occur. to understand children's conceptual model of iuis, we completed four consecutive participatory design sessions on designing iuis with an emphasis on error detection and correction. we found that, while children think of interactive systems in terms of both user input and behavior and system output and behavior, they also propose ideas that require advanced system intelligence, e.g., context and conversation. our work contributes new understanding of how children conceptualize iuis and new methods for error detection and correction, and will inform the design of future iuis for children to improve their experience.",572
Rethinking Engagement with Online News through Social and Visual Co-Annotation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657387,"the emergence of fake news, as well as filter bubbles and echo chambers, has precipitated renewed attention upon the ways in which news is consumed, shared and reflected and commented upon. while online news comments sections offer space for pluralist and critical discussion, studies suggest that this rarely occurs. motivated by common practices of annotating, defacing and scribbling on physical newspapers, we built a mobile app -- newsr -- that supports co-annotation, in the form of graffiti, on online news articles, which we evaluated in-the-wild for one month. we report on how the app encouraged participants to reflect upon the act of choosing news stories, whilst promoting exploration, the critique of content, and the exposure of bias within the writing. our findings highlight how the re-design of interactive online news experiences can facilitate more directed, ""in-the-moment"" critique of online news stories as well as encourage readers to expand the range of news content they read.",573
Season Traveller: Multisensory Narration for Enhancing the Virtual Reality Experience,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657388,"in the same way that we experience the real-world through a range of senses, experiencing a virtual environment through multiple sensory modalities may augment both our presence within a scenario and our reaction to it. in this paper, we present season traveller, a multisensory virtual reality (vr) narration of a journey through four seasons within a mystical realm. by adding olfactory and haptic (thermal and wind) stimuli, we extend traditional audio-visual vr technologies to achieve enhanced sensory engagement within interactive experiences. using both subjective measures of presence and elicited physiological responses, we evaluated the impact of different modalities on the virtual experience. our results indicate that 1) the addition of any singular modality improves sense of presence with respect to traditional audio-visual experiences and 2) providing a combination of these modalities produces a further significant enhancement over the aforementioned improvements. furthermore, insights into participants' psychophysiology were extrapolated from electrodermal activity (eda) and heart rate (hr) measurements during each of the vr experiences.",574

Mercury: A Messaging Framework for Modular UI Components,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657399,"in recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as unity and unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3d user interfaces. in these systems, ui components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. in some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. when components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular uis cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. to address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, mercury, to facilitate communication among components. we provide an overview of mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in unity, and present example systems built using mercury to explain its advantages.",585
Characterizing Finger Pitch and Roll Orientation During Atomic Touch Actions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657390,"atomic interactions in touch interfaces, like tap, drag, and flick, are well understood in terms of interaction design, but less is known about their physical performance characteristics. we carried out a study to gather baseline data about finger pitch and roll orientation during atomic touch input actions. our results show differences in orientation and range for different fingers, hands, and actions, and we analyse the effect of tablet angle. our data provides designers and researchers with a new resource to better understand what interactions are possible in different settings ( e.g.  when using the left or right hand), to design novel interaction techniques that use orientation as input (e.g. using finger tilt as an implicit mode), and to determine whether new sensing techniques are feasible (e.g. using fingerprints for identifying specific finger touches).",586
Extending Manual Drawing Practices with Artist-Centric Programming Tools,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657391,"procedural art, or art made with programming, suggests opportunities to extend traditional arts like painting and drawing; however, this potential is limited by tools that conflict with manual practices. programming languages present learning barriers and manual drawing input is not a first class primitive in common programming models. we hypothesize that by developing programming languages and environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace, manual art. to explore this, we developed dynamic brushes, a programming and drawing environment motivated by interviews with artists. dynamic brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data. results from an extended evaluation with artists provide guidelines for learnable, expressive systems that blend manual and procedural creation.",587

Somewhere Over the Rainbow: An Empirical Assessment of Quantitative Colormaps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657309,"an essential goal of quantitative color encoding is the accurate mapping of perceptual dimensions of color to the logical structure of data. prior research identifies weaknesses of 'rainbow' colormaps and advocates for ramping in luminance, while recent work contributes multi-hue colormaps generated using perceptually-uniform color models. we contribute a comparative analysis of different colormap types, with a focus on comparing single- and multi-hue schemes. we present a suite of experiments in which subjects perform relative distance judgments among color triplets drawn systematically from each of four single-hue and five multi-hue colormaps. we characterize speed and accuracy across each colormap, and identify conditions that degrade performance. we also find that a combination of perceptual color space and color naming measures more accurately predict user performance than either alone, though the overall accuracy is poor. based on these results, we distill recommendations on how to design more effective color encodings for scalar data.",595
Two Kinds of Novel Multi-user Immersive Display Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657300,"stereoscopic display is a standard display mode for virtual reality environments. typical 3d projection provides only a single stereoscopic video stream; thus co-located users cannot correctly perceive the virtual scene based on their own position and view. several works devoted to developing multi-user stereoscopic display, but the number of users is very limited or the technical implementation is complicated. in this paper we put forward two flexible and simple projection-based multi-user stereoscopic display systems. the first one, named tpa, is based on a triple-projector array and provides a 120hz active stereo for three users. two tpas can be combined to form a six-user system. the second one, named dpa, is a dual-projector and easy-implemented system providing individual stereoscopic video stream for two to six users. finally, a co-located multi-user virtual fireman simulation training system and a virtual tennis simulation system were created to verify the effectiveness of our systems.",596

Steering through Successive Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657304,"we investigate stroking motions through successive objects with styli. there are several promising models for stroking motions, such as crossing tasks, which require endpoint accuracy of a stroke, or steering tasks, which require continuous accuracy throughout the trajectory. however, a task requiring users to repeatedly steer through constrained path segments has never been studied, although such operations are needed in guis, e.g., for selecting icons or objects on illustration software through lassoing. we empirically confirmed that the interval, trajectory width, and obstacle size significantly affect the movement speed. existing models can not accurately predict user performance in such tasks. we found several unexpected results such as that steering through denser objects sometimes required less times than expected. speed profile analysis showed the reasons behind such behaviors, such as participants' anticipation strategies. we also discuss the applicability of exiting performance models and revisions.",600
The Ethnobot: Gathering Ethnographies in the Age of IoT,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657315,"computational systems and objects are becoming increasingly closely integrated with our daily activities. ubiquitous and pervasive computing first identified the emerging challenges of studying technology used on-the-move and in widely varied contexts. with iot, previously sporadic experiences are interconnected across time and space in numerous and complex ways. this increasing complexity has multiplied the challenges facing those who study human experience to inform design. this paper describes the results of a study that used a chatbot or 'ethnobot' to gather ethnographic data, and considers the opportunities and challenges in collecting this data in the absence of a human ethnographer. this study involved 13 participants gathering information about their experiences at the royal highland show. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ethnobot in this setting, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of chatbots as a tool for ethnographic data collection, and conclude with recommendations for the design of chatbots for this purpose.",601
An Experimental Study of Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657316,"as cryptocurrencies gain popularity and credibility, marketplaces for cryptocurrencies are growing in importance. understanding the dynamics of these markets can help to assess how viable the cryptocurrnency ecosystem is and how design choices affect market behavior. one existential threat to cryptocurrencies is dramatic fluctuations in traders' willingness to buy or sell. using a novel experimental methodology, we conducted an online experiment to study how susceptible traders in these markets are to peer influence from trading behavior. we created bots that executed over one hundred thousand trades costing less than a penny each in 217 cryptocurrencies over the course of six months. we find that individual ""buy"" actions led to short-term increases in subsequent buy-side activity hundreds of times the size of our interventions. from a design perspective, we note that the design choices of the exchange we study may have promoted this and other peer influence effects, which highlights the potential social and economic impact of hci in the design of digital institutions.",602
Paragon: An Online Gallery for Enhancing Design Feedback with Visual Examples,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657317,"examples provide a source of inspiration for creating designs, but can they help improve the feedback process? supplementing design feedback with examples could help recipients see issues clearly, identify concrete steps for improvement, and integrate novel ideas. two online studies investigated how to support novices providing feedback on visual poster designs in an online context. study one found that feedback providers select poster examples that complement their feedback and align with a provided rubric. study two shows that feedback providers give more specific, actionable, and novel input when using an example-centric approach, as opposed to text alone. to support this, we designed paragon, an interface to efficiently browse examples using metadata. finally, we discuss implications for collecting examples from the web and structuring the design feedback process.",603
"Personality Depends on The Medium: Differences in Self-Perception on Snapchat, Facebook and Offline",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657318,"we investigate self-perception in social media through the lens of personality theory. two mixed-methods studies involving 148 participants examine if people self-report different personality traits in social media compared with their offline traits. we first compare offline and facebook traits, finding that on facebook people are less neurotic, open and agreeable. a second study compared offline, facebook and snapchat traits, replicating and extending our initial results. again facebook personality was less neurotic and less open than offline. in contrast, snapchat personality was more extravert than both offline and facebook and more open than facebook. interviews indicate how personality differences arise from social media affordances. anxiety about audience judgments leads people to curate posts to appear less neurotic on social media, but the transience of snapchat promotes greater extraversion than offline and facebook. we discuss theory and design implications.",604
"""We Don't Do That Here"": How Collaborative Editing with Mentors Improves Engagement in Social Q&A Communities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657319,"online question-and-answer (q&a) communities like stack overflow have norms that are not obvious to novice users. novices create and post programming questions without feedback, and the community enforces site norms through public downvoting and commenting. this can leave novices discouraged from further participation. we deployed a month long, just-in-time mentorship program to stack overflow in which we redirected novices in the process of asking a question to an on-site help room. there, novices received feedback on their question drafts from experienced stack overflow mentors. we present examples and discussion of various question improvements including: question context, code formatting, and wording that adheres to on-site cultural norms. we find that mentored questions are substantially improved over non-mentored questions, with average scores increasing by 50%. we provide design implications that challenge how socio-technical communities onboard novices across domains.",605
Using High Frequency Accelerometer and Mouse to Compensate for End-to-end Latency in Indirect Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657310,"end-to-end latency corresponds to the temporal difference between a user input and the corresponding output from a system. it has been shown to degrade user performance in both direct and indirect interaction. if it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. in this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. we combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using euler based equations. our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch. a controlled experiment also revealed that it can improve target acquisition time in pointing tasks.",606

Investigating Perceptual Congruence between Data and Display Dimensions in Sonification,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657312,"the relationships between sounds and their perceived meaning and connotations are complex, making auditory perception an important factor to consider when designing sonification systems. listeners often have a mental model of how a data variable should sound during sonification and this model is not considered in most data:sound mappings. this can lead to mappings that are difficult to use and can cause confusion. to investigate this issue, we conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how roughness, noise and pitch relate to the perceived magnitude of stress, error and danger. these parameters were chosen due to previous findings which suggest perceptual congruency between these auditory sensations and conceptual variables. results from this experiment show that polarity and scaling preference are dependent on the data:sound mapping. this work provides polarity and scaling values that may be directly utilised by sonification designers to improve auditory displays in areas such as accessible and mobile computing, process-monitoring and biofeedback.",608
Acceptability and Acceptance of Autonomous Mobility on Demand: The Impact of an Immersive Experience,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657313,"autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally change existing transportation systems. beyond legal concerns, these societal evolutions will critically depend on user acceptance. as an emerging mode of public transportation [7], autonomous mobility on demand (amod) is of particular interest in this context. the aim of the present study is to identify the main components of acceptability (before first use) and acceptance (after first use) of amod, following a user experience (ux) framework. to address this goal, we conducted three workshops (n=14) involving open discussions and a ride in an experimental autonomous shuttle. using a mixed-methods approach, we measured pre-immersion acceptability before immersing the participants in an on-demand transport scenario, and eventually measured post-immersion acceptance of amod. results show that participants were reassured about safety concerns, however they perceived the amod experience as ineffective. our findings highlight key factors to be taken into account when designing amod experiences.",609
BioFidget: Biofeedback for Respiration Training Using an Augmented Fidget Spinner,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657314,"this paper presents biofidget, a biofeedback system that integrates physiological sensing and display into a smart fidget spinner for respiration training. we present a simple yet novel hardware design that transforms a fidget spinner into 1) a nonintrusive heart rate variability (hrv) sensor, 2) an electromechanical respiration sensor, and 3) an information display. the combination of these features enables users to engage in respiration training through designed tangible and embodied interactions, without requiring them to wear additional physiological sensors. the results of this empirical user study prove that the respiration training method reduces stress, and the proposed system meets the requirements of sensing validity and engagement with 32 participants in a practical setting.",610
Gender-Inclusive Design: Sense of Belonging and Bias in Web Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657325,"we interact with dozens of web interfaces on a daily basis, making inclusive web design practices more important than ever. this paper investigates the impacts of web interface design on ambient belonging, or the sense of belonging to a community or culture. our experiment deployed two content-identical webpages for an introductory computer science course, differing only in aesthetic features such that one was perceived as masculine while the other was gender-neutral. our results confirm that young women exposed to the masculine page are negatively affected, reporting significantly less ambient belonging, interest in the course and in studying computer science broadly. they also experience significantly more concern about others' perception of their gender relative to young women exposed to the neutral page, while no similar effect is seen in young men. these results suggest that gender biases can be triggered by web design, highlighting the need for inclusive user interface design for the web.",611
Too Close and Crowded: Understanding Stress on Mobile Instant Messengers based on Proxemics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657326,"nowadays, mobile instant messaging (mim) is a necessity for our private and public lives, but it has also been the cause of stress. in south korea, mim stress has become a serious social problem. to understand this stress, we conducted four focus groups with 20 participants under mim stress. we initially discovered that mim stress relates to how people perceive the territory in mim. we then applied proxemics-the theory of human use of space-to the thematic analysis as the rationale. the data revealed two main themes: too close and too crowded. the participants were stressed due to design features that let strangers or crowds into their mim applications and forced them to interact and share their status with them. based on this finding, we propose a set of implications for designing anti-stress mim applications.",612
Socioeconomic Inequalities in the Non use of Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657327,"use and non-use of technology can occur in a variety of forms. this paper analyzes data from a probabilistic sample of 1000 us households to identify predictors for four different types of use and non-use of the social media site facebook. the results make three important contributions. first, they demonstrate that many demographic and socioeconomic predictors of social media use and non-use identified in prior studies hold with a larger, more diverse sample. second, they show how going beyond a binary distinction between use and non-use reveals inequalities in social media use and non-use not identified in prior work. third, they contribute to ongoing discussions about the representativeness of social media data by showing which populations are, and are not, represented in samples drawn from social media.",613
Navigation Systems for Motorcyclists: Exploring Wearable Tactile Feedback for Route Guidance in the Real World,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657328,"current navigation systems for motor cyclists use visual or auditory cues for guidance. however, this poses a challenge to the motorcyclists since their visual and auditory channels are already occupied with controlling the motorbike, paying attention to other road users, and planing the next turn. in this work, we explore how tactile feedback can be used to guide motorcyclists. we present moving (motorbike vibrational navigation guidance), a smart kidney belt that presents navigation cues through 12 vibration motors. in addition, we report on the design process of this wearable and on an evaluation with 16 participants in a real world riding setting. we show that moving outperforms off-the-shelf navigation systems in terms of turn errors and distraction.",614

Morphees+: Studying Everyday Reconfigurable Objects for the Design and Taxonomy of Reconfigurable UIs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657320,"users interact with many reconfigurable objects in daily life. these objects embed reconfigurations and shape- changing features that users are familiar with. for this reason, everyday reconfigurable objects have informed the design and taxonomy of shape changing ui. however, they have never been explored systematically. in this paper, we present a data set of 82 everyday reconfigurable objects that we collected in a workshop. we discuss how they can inspire the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we particularly focus on taxonomies of reconfigurable interfaces. taxonomies have been suggested to help design and communication among researchers, however despite their extensive use, taxonomies are rarely evaluated. this paper analyses two established taxonomies - rasmussen's and roudaut's - using daily reconfigurable objects. we show relationships between the taxonomies and area for improvements. we propose morphees+, a refined taxonomy based on roudaut's shape resolution taxonomy.",616
The Theory-Practice Gap as Generative Metaphor,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657321,"the theory-practice gap is a well-known concept in hci research. it provides a way of describing a space that allegedly exists between the theory and practice of the field, and it has inspired many researchers to propose ways to ""bridge the gap."" in this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of the gap as a generative metaphor that frames problems and guides researchers towards possible solutions. we examine how the metaphor has emerged in hci discourse, and what its limitations might be. our examination raises concerns about treating the gap as given or obvious, which could reflect researchers' tendencies to adopt a problem-solving perspective. we discuss the value of considering problem setting in relation to the theory-practice gap, and then explore derrida's strategy of ""reversal"" as a possible way to develop new metaphors to capture the relationship between theory and practice.",617
Playing to Wait: A Taxonomy of Idle Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657322,"idle games are a recent minimalist gaming phenomenon in which the game is left running with little player interaction. we deepen understanding of idle games and their characteristics by developing a taxonomy and identifying game features. this paper examines 66 idle games using a grounded theory approach to analyze play, game mechanics, rewards, interactivity, progress rate, and user interface. to establish a clearly bounded definition of idle games, we analyzed 10 non-idle games with the same approach. we discuss how idle games move players from playing to planning, how they question dominant assumptions about gameplay, and their unusual use of resources such as player attention and computer cycles. our work illuminates opportunities for the design of idle games, suggests design implications, and provides a framework for researchers to clearly articulate questions about this genre.",618
Empowering Families Facing English Literacy Challenges to Jointly Engage in Computer Programming,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657323,"research suggests that parental engagement through joint media engagement (jme) is an important factor in children's learning for coding and programming. unfortunately, parents with limited technology background may have difficulty supporting their children's access to programming. english-language learning (ell) families from marginalized communities face particular challenges in understanding and supporting programming, as code is primarily authored using english text. we present blockstudio, a programming tool for empowering ell families to jointly engage in introductory coding, using an environment embodying two design principles, text-free and visually concrete. we share a case study involving three community centers serving immigrant and refugee populations. our findings show ell families can jointly engage in programming without text, via co-creation and flexible roles, and can create a range of artifacts, indicating understanding of aspects of programming within this environment. we conclude with implications for coding together in ell families and design ideas for text-free programming research.",619

Training Person-Specific Gaze Estimators from User Interactions with Multiple Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657335,"learning-based gaze estimation has significant potential to enable attentive user interfaces and gaze-based interaction on the billions of camera-equipped handheld devices and ambient displays. while training accurate person- and device-independent gaze estimators remains challenging, person-specific training is feasible but requires tedious data collection for each target device. to address these limitations, we present the first method to train person-specific gaze estimators across multiple devices. at the core of our method is a single convolutional neural network with shared feature extraction layers and device-specific branches that we train from face images and corresponding on-screen gaze locations. detailed evaluations on a new dataset of interactions with five common devices (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, smart tv) and three common applications (mobile game, text editing, media center) demonstrate the significant potential of cross-device training. we further explore training with gaze locations derived from natural interactions, such as mouse or touch input.",621
Designing for Diabetes Decision Support Systems with Fluid Contextual Reasoning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657336,"type 1 diabetes is a potentially life-threatening chronic condition that requires frequent interactions with diverse data to inform treatment decisions. while mobile technologies such as blood glucose meters have long been an essential part of this process, designing interfaces that explicitly support decision-making remains challenging. dual-process models are a common approach to understanding such cognitive tasks. however, evidence from the first of two studies we present suggests that in demanding and complex situations, some individuals approach disease management in distinctive ways that do not seem to fit well within existing models. this finding motivated, and helped frame our second study, a survey (n=192) to investigate these behaviors in more detail. on the basis of the resulting analysis, we posit fluid contextual reasoning to explain how some people with diabetes respond to particular situations, and discuss how an extended framework might help inform the design of user interfaces for diabetes management.",622
"The Impact of Word, Multiple Word, and Sentence Input on Virtual Keyboard Decoding Performance",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657337,"entering text on non-desktop computing devices is often done via an onscreen virtual keyboard. input on such keyboards normally consists of a sequence of noisy tap events that specify some amount of text, most commonly a single word. but is single word-at-a-time entry the best choice? this paper compares user performance and recognition accuracy of word-at-a-time, phrase-at-a-time, and sentence-at-a-time text entry on a smartwatch keyboard. we evaluate the impact of differing amounts of input in both text copy and free composition tasks. we found providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm while keeping character error rates below 4%. in offline experiments with more processing power and memory, sentence input was recognized with a much lower 2.0% error rate. our findings suggest virtual keyboards can enhance performance by encouraging users to provide more input per recognition event.",623
Designing the Future of Personal Fashion,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657338,"advances in computer vision and machine learning are changing the way people dress and buy clothes. given the vast space of fashion problems, where can data-driven technologies provide the most value? to understand consumer pain points and opportunities for technological interventions, this paper presents the results from two independent need-finding studies that explore the gold-standard of personalized shopping: interacting with a personal stylist. through interviews with five personal stylists, we study the range of problems they address and their in-person processes for working with clients. in a separate study, we investigate how styling experiences map to online settings by building and releasing a chatbot that connects users to one-on-one sessions with a stylist, acquiring more than 70 organic users in three weeks. these conversations reveal that in-person and online styling sessions share similar goals, but online sessions often involve smaller problems that can be resolved more quickly. based on these explorations, we propose future highly personalized, online interactions that address consumer trust and uncertainty, and discuss opportunities for automation.",624
To Distort or Not to Distort: Distance Cartograms in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657339,"distance cartograms (dc) distort geographical features so that the measured distance between a single location and any other location on a map indicates absolute travel time. although studies show that users can efficiently assess travel time with dc, distortion applied in dc may confuse users, and its usefulness ""in the wild"" is unknown. to understand how real world users perceive dc's benefits and drawbacks, we devise techniques that improve dc's presentation (preserving topological relationships among map features while aiming at retaining shapes) and scalability (presenting accurate live travel time). we developed a dc-enabled system with these techniques, and deployed it to 20 participants for 4 weeks. during this period, participants spent, on average, more than 50% of their time with dc as opposed to a standard map. participants felt dc to be intuitive and useful for assessing travel time. they indicated intent in adopting dc in their real-life scenarios.",625
Towards a Multisensory Augmented Reality Map for Blind and Low Vision People: a Participatory Design Approach,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657330,"current low-tech orientation & mobility (o&m) tools for visually impaired people, e.g. tactile maps, possess limitations. interactive accessible maps have been developed to overcome these. however, most of them are limited to exploration of existing maps, and have remained in laboratories. using a participatory design approach, we have worked closely with 15 visually impaired students and 3 o&m instructors over 6 months. we iteratively designed and developed an augmented reality map destined at use in o&m classes in special education centers. this prototype combines projection, audio output and use of tactile tokens, and thus allows both map exploration and construction by low vision and blind people. our user study demonstrated that all students were able to successfully use the prototype, and showed a high user satisfaction. a second phase with 22 international special education teachers allowed us to gain more qualitative insights. this work shows that augmented reality has potential for improving the access to education for visually impaired people.",626
Scaling Classroom IT Skill Tutoring: A Case Study from India,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657331,"india is home to the largest under-25 demographic profile in the world, but lacks a job-ready educational system. it requires a wide-spread, skill-oriented educational model, equipping youth to thrive in highly dynamic job markets. as a response to the huge demand for technical education, a large private skill-tutoring ecosystem has sprung up in in-dia but remains geographically limited. this paper, drawn from a three-month ethnographic research conducted in ameerpet (arguably india's largest it skilling hub), probes the pedagogic style and characteristics of tutoring, and of-fers reasons why learners prefer to enroll into a physical model of classroom teaching over online courses. we make design suggestions for online learning platforms to attract students who are marginalized in the more formal and com-petitive education system, and opt for ameerpet-like skill-hubs. our primary offering is to suggest a shift in perspec-tive of online education platforms to include job readiness and accompanying changes in course content and delivery.",627
Regulating Feelings During Interpersonal Conflicts by Changing Voice Self-perception,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657332,"emotions play a major role in how interpersonal conflicts unfold. although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require conscious attention and effort. this often limits their efficacy in practice. in this paper, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artificially change their perceptions to influence their emotions. we conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. in one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conflicts felt less anxious. in the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. we discuss the implications of our findings and the opportunities for designing automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems.",628
Flotation Simulation in a Cable-driven Virtual Environment -- A Study with Parasailing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657333,"this paper presents flotation simulation in a cable-driven virtual environment. for this, a virtual parasailing system was developed, where the visual stimulus was provided through a vr headset and the physical stimulus was given by wires. in order to prevent the user from moving out of the limited workspace of the cable-driven system, the visual acceleration was washout-filtered to produce the physical acceleration. in the parasailing trajectory, we focused on the stages of vertical acceleration/deceleration and conducted an experiment to identify how much gain can be applied to the visual acceleration, which makes the user feel the natural self-motion when integrated with physical stimulus. then, the results were tested using several types of full-course virtual parasailing. the results showed that fairly large differences between visual and physical stimuli would be accepted and different gains could be assigned depending on the user's altitudes.",629

NavigaTone: Seamlessly Embedding Navigation Cues in Mobile Music Listening,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657348,"as humans, we have the natural capability of localizing the origin of sounds. spatial audio rendering leverages this skill by applying special filters to recorded audio to create the impression that a sound emanates from a certain position in the physical space. a main application for spatial audio on mobile devices is to provide non-visual navigation cues. current systems require users to either listen to artificial beacon sounds, or the entire audio source (e.g., a song) is repositioned in space, which impacts the listening experience. we present navigatone, a system that takes advantage of multi-track recordings and provides directional cues by moving a single track in the auditory space. while minimizing the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience, a user study showed that participants could localize sources as good as with stereo panning while the listening experience was rated to be closer to common music listening.",634
Considering Agency and Data Granularity in the Design of Visualization Tools,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657349,"previous research has identified trade-offs when it comes to designing visualization tools. while constructive ""bottom-up' tools promote a hands-on, user-driven design process that enables a deep understanding and control of the visual mapping, automated tools are more efficient and allow people to rapidly explore complex alternative designs, often at the cost of transparency. we investigate how to design visualization tools that support a user-driven, transparent design process while enabling efficiency and automation, through a series of design workshops that looked at how both visualization experts and novices approach this problem. participants produced a variety of solutions that range from example-based approaches expanding constructive visualization to solutions in which the visualization tool infers solutions on behalf of the designer, e.g., based on data attributes. on a higher level, these findings highlight agency and granularity as dimensions that can guide the design of visualization tools in this space.",635

Mental Health Support and its Relationship to Linguistic Accommodation in Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657342,"many online communities cater to the critical and unmet needs of individuals challenged with mental illnesses. generally, communities engender characteristic linguistic practices, known as norms. conformance to these norms, or linguistic accommodation, encourages social approval and acceptance. this paper investigates whether linguistic accommodation impacts a specific social feedback: the support received by an individual in an online mental health community. we first quantitatively derive two measures for each post in these communities: 1) the linguistic accommodation it exhibits, and 2) the level of support it receives. thereafter, we build a statistical framework to examine the relationship between these measures. although the extent to which accommodation is associated with support varies, we find a positive link between the two, consistent across 55 reddit communities serving various psychological needs. we discuss how our work surfaces a tension in the functioning of these sensitive communities, and present design implications for improving their support provisioning mechanisms.",638
Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657343,"understanding uncertainty is critical for many analytical tasks. one common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty values independently, using two visual variables. these resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and interference between visual channels can reduce the discriminability of marks. to address this issue, we contribute value-suppressing uncertainty palettes (vsups). vsups allocate larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. this non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more economical use of the limited visual encoding space when uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making when uncertainty is high. we demonstrate several examples of vsups, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, vsups encourage people to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.",639
Baang: A Viral Speech-based Social Platform for Under-Connected Populations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657344,"speech is more natural than text for a large part of the world including hard-to-reach populations (low-literate, poor, tech-novice, visually-impaired, marginalized) and oral cultures. voice-based services over simple mobile phones are effective means to provide orality-driven social connectivity to such populations. we present baang, a versatile and inclusive voice-based social platform that allows audio content creation and sharing among its open community of users. within 8 months, baang spread virally to 10,721 users (69% of them blind) who participated in 269,468 calls and shared their thoughts via 44,178 audio-posts, 343,542 votes, 124,389 audio-comments and 94,864 shares. we show that the ability to vote, comment and share leads to viral spread, deeper engagement, longer retention and emergence of true dialog among participants. beyond connectivity, baang provides its users with a voice and a social identity as well as means to share information and get community support.",640
Haptic Links: Bimanual Haptics for Virtual Reality Using Variable Stiffness Actuation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657455,"we present haptic links, electro-mechanically actuated physical connections capable of rendering variable stiffness between two commodity handheld virtual reality (vr) controllers. when attached, haptic links can dynamically alter the forces perceived between the user's hands to support the haptic rendering of a variety of two-handed objects and interactions. they can rigidly lock controllers in an arbitrary configuration, constrain specific degrees of freedom or directions of motion, and dynamically set stiffness along a continuous range. we demonstrate and compare three prototype haptic links: chain, layer-hinge, and ratchet-hinge. we then describe interaction techniques and scenarios leveraging the capabilities of each. our user evaluation results confirm that users can perceive many two-handed objects or interactions as more realistic with haptic links than with typical unlinked vr controllers.",641
Breeze: Sharing Biofeedback through Wearable Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657456,"digitally presenting physiological signals as biofeedback to users raises awareness of both body and mind. this paper describes the effectiveness of conveying a physiological signal often overlooked for communication: breathing. we present the design and development of digital breathing patterns and their evaluation along three output modalities: visual, audio, and haptic. we also present breeze, a wearable pendant placed around the neck that measures breathing and sends biofeedback in real-time. we evaluated how the breathing patterns were interpreted in a fixed environment and gathered qualitative data on the wearable device's design. we found that participants intentionally modified their own breathing to match the biofeedback, as a technique for understanding the underlying emotion. our results describe how the features of the breathing patterns and the feedback modalities influenced participants' perception. we include guidelines and suggested use cases, such as breeze being used by loved ones to increase connectedness and empathy.",642
eystrokes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657457,"we report on typing behaviour and performance of 168,000 volunteers in an online study. the large dataset allows detailed statistical analyses of keystroking patterns, linking them to typing performance. besides reporting distributions and confirming some earlier findings, we report two new findings. first, letter pairs that are typed by different hands or fingers are more predictive of typing speed than, for example, letter repetitions. second, rollover-typing, wherein the next key is pressed before the previous one is released, is sur- prisingly prevalent. notwithstanding considerable variation in typing patterns, unsupervised clustering using normalised inter-key intervals reveals that most users can be divided into eight groups of typists that differ in performance, accuracy, hand and finger usage, and rollover. the code and dataset are released for scientific use.",643
Selection-based Text Entry in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657458,"in recent years, virtual reality (vr) and 3d user interfaces (3dui) have seen a drastic increase in popularity, especially in terms of consumer-ready hardware and software. while the technology for input as well as output devices is market ready, only a few solutions for text input exist, and empirical knowledge about performance and user preferences is lacking. in this paper, we study text entry in vr by selecting characters on a virtual keyboard. we discuss the design space for assessing selection-based text entry in vr. then, we implement six methods that span different parts of the design space and evaluate their performance and user preferences. our results show that pointing using tracked hand-held controllers outperforms all other methods. other methods such as head pointing can be viable alternatives depending on available resources. we summarize our findings by formulating guidelines for choosing optimal virtual keyboard text entry methods in vr.",644
Effects of Viewing Multiple Viewpoint Videos on Metacognition of Collaborative Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657459,"this paper discusses the effects of multiple viewpoint videos for metacognition of experiences. we present a system for recording multiple users' collaborative experiences by wearable and environmental sensors, and another system for viewing multiple viewpoint videos automatically identified and extracted to associate to individual users. we designed an experiment to compare the metacognition of one's own experience between those based on memory and those supported by video viewing. the experimental results show that metacognitive descriptions related to one's own mind, such as feelings and preferences, are possible regardless whether a person is viewing videos, but such episodic descriptions as the content of someone's utterance and what s/he felt associated with it are strongly promoted by video viewing. we conducted another experiment where the same participants did identical metacognitive description tasks about half a year after the previous experiment. through the experiments, we found the first-person view video is mostly used for confirming the episodic facts immediately after the experience, whereas after half a year, even one's own experience is often felt like the experiences of others therefore the videos capturing themselves from the conversation partners and environment become important for thinking back to the situations where they were placed.",645
"I Lead, You Help but Only with Enough Details: Understanding User Experience of Co-Creation with Artificial Intelligence",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657450,"recent advances in artificial intelligence (ai) have increased the opportunities for users to interact with the technology. now, users can even collaborate with ai in creative activities such as art. to understand the user experience in this new user--ai collaboration, we designed a prototype, duetdraw, an ai interface that allows users and the ai agent to draw pictures collaboratively. we conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. our findings are as follows: (1) users were significantly more content with duetdraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) while users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the ai to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) although users rated the ai relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with ai in creative works.",646
Supporting Collaborative Health Tracking in the Hospital: Patients' Perspectives,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657451,"the hospital setting creates a high-stakes environment where patients' lives depend on accurate tracking of health data. despite recent work emphasizing the importance of patients' engagement in their own health care, less is known about how patients track their health and care in the hospital. through interviews and design probes, we investigated hospitalized patients' tracking activity and analyzed our results using the stage-based personal informatics model. we used this model to understand how to support the tracking needs of hospitalized patients at each stage. in this paper, we discuss hospitalized patients' needs for collaboratively tracking their health with their care team. we suggest future extensions of the stage-based model to accommodate collaborative tracking situations, such as hospitals, where data is collected, analyzed, and acted on by multiple people. our findings uncover new directions for hci research and highlight ways to support patients in tracking their care and improving patient safety.",647
Investigating the Impact of Gender on Rank in Resume Search Engines,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657452,"in this work we investigate gender-based inequalities in the context of resume search engines, which are tools that allow recruiters to proactively search for candidates based on keywords and filters. if these ranking algorithms take demographic features into account (directly or indirectly), they may produce rankings that disadvantage some candidates. we collect search results from indeed, monster, and careerbuilder based on 35 job titles in 20 u. s. cities, resulting in data on 855k job candidates. using statistical tests, we examine whether these search engines produce rankings that exhibit two types of indirect discrimination: individual and group unfairness. furthermore, we use controlled experiments to show that these websites do not use inferred gender of candidates as explicit features in their ranking algorithms.",648
Cognitive Load Estimation in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657453,"cognitive load has been shown, over hundreds of validated studies, to be an important variable for understanding human performance. however, establishing practical, non-contact approaches for automated estimation of cognitive load under real-world conditions is far from a solved problem. toward the goal of designing such a system, we propose two novel vision-based methods for cognitive load estimation, and evaluate them on a large-scale dataset collected under real-world driving conditions. cognitive load is defined by which of 3 levels of a validated reference task the observed subject was performing. on this 3-class problem, our best proposed method of using 3d convolutional neural networks achieves 86.1% accuracy at predicting task-induced cognitive load in a sample of 92 subjects from video alone. this work uses the driving context as a training and evaluation dataset, but the trained network is not constrained to the driving environment as it requires no calibration and makes no assumptions about the subject's visual appearance, activity, head pose, scale, and perspective.",649
The Effect of Offset Correction and Cursor on Mid-Air Pointing in Real and Virtual Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657454,"pointing at remote objects to direct others' attention is a fundamental human ability. previous work explored methods for remote pointing to select targets. absolute pointing techniques that cast a ray from the user to a target are affected by humans' limited pointing accuracy. recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. in this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. in the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. we show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided. we further show that a cursor improves pointing accuracy but also increases the selection time.",650
"CLAW: A Multifunctional Handheld Haptic Controller for Grasping, Touching, and Triggering in Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657465,"claw is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. a servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. claw also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. we describe the design considerations for claw and evaluate its performance through two user studies. the first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. the second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device.",651
Ripple Thermostat: Affecting the Emotional Experience through Interactive Force Feedback and Shape Change,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657466,"force feedback and shape change are modalities with a growing application potential beyond the more traditional guis. we present two studies that explored the effect of these modalities on the emotional experience when interacting with an intelligent thermostat. the first study compared visual feedback, force feedback, and a combination of force feedback and shape change. results indicate that force feedback correlates to experienced dominance during interaction, while shape change mainly affects experienced arousal. the second study explored how force feedback and shape change could communicate affective meaning during interaction with the thermostat through a co-design study. participants designed the thermostat behavior for three scenarios supporting energy savings. results suggest that despite their abstractness, force feedback and shape change convey affective meaning during the user-system dialogue. the findings contribute to the design of intelligible and intuitive feedback.",652
A Qualitative Exploration of Perceptions of Algorithmic Fairness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657467,"algorithmic systems increasingly shape information people are exposed to as well as influence decisions about employment, finances, and other opportunities. in some cases, algorithmic systems may be more or less favorable to certain groups or individuals, sparking substantial discussion of algorithmic fairness in public policy circles, academia, and the press. we broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. we conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the united states. while the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussions about racial injustice and economic inequality. in addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product.",653
The Benefits and Challenges of Video Calling for Emergency Situations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657468,"in the coming years, emergency calling services in north america will begin to incorporate new modalities for reporting emergencies, including video-based calling. the challenge is that we know little of how video calling systems should be designed and what benefits or challenges video calling might bring. we conducted observations and contextual interviews within three emergency response call centres to investigate these points. we focused on the work practices of call takers and dispatchers. results show that video calls could provide valuable contextual information about a situation and help to overcome call taker challenges with information ambiguity, location, deceit, and communication issues. yet video calls have the potential to introduce issues around control, information overload, and privacy if systems are not designed well. these results point to the need to think about emergency video calling along a continuum of visual modalities ranging from audio calls accompanied with images or video clips to one-way video streams to two-way video streams where camera control and camera work need to be carefully designed.",654
Whiskers: Exploring the Use of Ultrasonic Haptic Cues on the Face,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657469,"haptic cues are a valuable feedback mechanism for smart glasses. prior work has shown how they can support navigation, deliver notifications and cue targets. however, a focus on actuation technologies such as mechanical tactors or fans has restricted the scope of research to a small number of cues presented at fixed locations. to move beyond this limitation, we explore perception of in-air ultrasonic haptic cues on the face. we present two studies examining the fundamental properties of localization, duration and movement perception on three facial sites suitable for use with glasses: the cheek, the center of the forehead, and above the eyebrow. the center of the forehead led to optimal performance with a localization error of 3.77mm and accurate duration (80%) and movement perception (87%). we apply these findings in a study delivering eight different ultrasonic notifications and report mean recognition rates of up to 92.4% (peak: 98.6%). we close with design recommendations for ultrasonic haptic cues on the face.",655
Let's Play!: Digital and Analog Play between Preschoolers and Parents,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657460,"play is an enjoyable and developmentally useful part of early childhood, and parent-child play is a highly productive mechanism by which children learn to participate in the world. we conducted an observational lab study to examine how 15 parent-child pairs (children age 4-6) respond to and play with tablet apps as compared to analog toys. we found that parents and children were less likely to engage with each other or to respond to each other's bids for attention during play sessions with tab-lets versus play sessions with toys. we also observed that specific design features of tablet devices and children's apps-such as one-sided interfaces, game paradigms that demand continual attention, and lack of support for parallel interaction-are the primary mechanism shaping these differences. we provide guidance suggesting how children's apps might be re-designed to preserve the ad-vantages of digital play experiences while also evolving to build in the advantages of traditional toys.",656
Combating Attrition in Digital Self-Improvement Programs using Avatar Customization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657461,"digital self-improvement programs (e.g., interventions, training programs, self-help apps) are widely accessible, but can not employ the same degree of external regulation as programs delivered in controlled environments. as a result, they suffer from high attrition -- even the best programs won't work if people don't use them. we propose that volitional engagement -- facilitated through avatar customization -- can help combat attrition. we asked 250 participants to engage daily for 3 weeks in a one-minute breathing exercise for anxiety reduction, using either a generic avatar or one that they customized. customizing an avatar resulted in significantly less attrition and more sustained engagement as measured through login counts. the problem of attrition affects self-improvement programs across a range of do-mains; we provide a subtle, versatile, and broadly-applicable solution.",657
"Use the Force Picker, Luke: Space-Efficient Value Input on Force-Sensitive Mobile Touchscreens",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657462,"picking values from long ordered lists, such as when setting a date or time, is a common task on smartphones. however, the system pickers and tables used for this require significant screen space for spinning and dragging, covering other information or pushing it off-screen. the force picker reduces this footprint by letting users increase and decrease values over a wide range using force touch for rate-based control. however, changing input direction this way is difficult. we propose three techniques to address this. with our best candidate, thumb-roll, the force picker lets untrained users achieve similar accuracy as a standard picker, albeit less quickly. shrinking it to a single table row, 20% of the ios picker height, slightly affects completion time, but not accuracy. intriguingly, after 70 minutes of training, users were significantly faster with this minimized thumb-roll picker compared to the standard picker, at the same accuracy and only 6% of the gesture footprint. we close with application examples.",658
Live Sketch: Video-driven Dynamic Deformation of Static Drawings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657463,"creating sketch animations using traditional tools requires special artistic skills, and is tedious even for trained professionals. to lower the barrier for creating sketch animations, we propose a new system, emphlive sketch,&lt;/i&gt; which allows novice users to interactively bring static drawings to life by applying deformation-based animation effects that are extracted from video examples. dynamic deformation is first extracted as a sparse set of moving control points from videos and then transferred to a static drawing. our system addresses a few major technical challenges, such as motion extraction from video, video-to-sketch alignment, and many-to-one motion-driven sketch animation. while each of the sub-problems could be difficult to solve fully automatically, we present reliable solutions by combining new computational algorithms with intuitive user interactions. our pilot study shows that our system allows both users with or without animation skills to easily add dynamic deformation to static drawings.",659
ECGLens: Interactive Visual Exploration of Large Scale ECG Data for Arrhythmia Detection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657464,"the electrocardiogram (ecg) is commonly used to detect arrhythmias. traditionally, a single ecg observation is used for diagnosis, making it difficult to detect irregular arrhythmias. recent technology developments, however, have made it cost-effective to collect large amounts of raw ecg data over time. this promises to improve diagnosis accuracy, but the large data volume presents new challenges for cardiologists. this paper introduces ecglens, an interactive system for arrhythmia detection and analysis using large-scale ecg data. our system integrates an automatic heartbeat classification algorithm based on convolutional neural network, an outlier detection algorithm, and a set of rich interaction techniques. we also introduce a-glyph, a novel glyph designed to improve the readability and comparison of ecg signals. we report results from a comprehensive user study showing that a-glyph improves the efficiency in arrhythmia detection, and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecglens in arrhythmia detection through two expert interviews.",660

Fast & Furious: Detecting Stress with a Car Steering Wheel,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657476,"stress affects the lives of millions of people every day. in-situ sensing could enable just-in-time stress management interventions. we present the first work to detect stress using the movements of a car's existing steering wheel. we extend prior work on pc peripherals and demonstrate that stress, expressed through muscle tension in the limbs, can be measured through the way we drive a car. we collected data in a driving simulator under controlled circumstances to vary the levels of induced stress, within subjects. we analyze angular displacement data to estimate coefficients related to muscle tension using an inverse filtering technique. we prove that the damped frequency of a mass spring damper model representing the arm is significantly higher during stress. stress can be detected with only a few turns during driving. we validate these measures against a known stressor and calibrate our sensor against known stress measurements.",662
Norms Matter: Contrasting Social Support Around Behavior Change in Online Weight Loss Communities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657477,"online health communities (ohcs) provide support across conditions; for weight loss, ohcs offer support to foster positive behavior change. however, weight loss behaviors can also be subverted on ohcs to promote disordered eating practices. using comments as proxies for support, we use computational linguistic methods to juxtapose similarities and differences in two reddit weight loss communities, r/proed and r/loseit. we employ language modeling and find that word use in both communities is largely similar. then, by building a word embedding model, specifically a deep neural network on comment words, we contrast the context of word use and find differences that imply different behavior change goals in these ohcs. finally, these content and context norms predict whether a comment comes from r/proed or r/loseit. we show that norms matter in understanding how different ohcs provision support to promote behavior change and discuss the implications for design and moderation of ohcs.",663
“A Stalker's Paradise”: How Intimate Partner Abusers Exploit Technology,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657478,"this paper describes a qualitative study with 89 participants that details how abusers in intimate partner violence (ipv) contexts exploit technologies to intimidate, threaten, monitor, impersonate, harass, or otherwise harm their victims. we show that, at their core, many of the attacks in ipv contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. for example, they are often carried out by a ui-bound adversary - an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim»s device or account via standard user interfaces - or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize ipv make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. we discuss the nature of these new ipv threat models and outline opportunities for hci research and design to mitigate these attacks.",664

Human-Centered Tools for Coping with Imperfect Algorithms During Medical Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300234,"machine learning (ml) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. one application of ml is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. however, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. in this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. in two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. the tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. we also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ml errors from their own errors. taken together, these findings inform future human-ml collaborative systems for expert decision-making.",668

Anchored Audio Sampling: A Seamless Method for Exploring Children's Thoughts During Deployment Studies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300238,"many traditional hci methods, such as surveys and interviews, are of limited value when working with preschoolers. in this paper, we present anchored audio sampling (aas), a remote data collection technique for extracting qualitative audio samples during field deployments with young children. aas offers a developmentally sensitive way of understanding how children make sense of technology and situates their use in the larger context of daily life. aas is defined by an anchor event, around which audio is collected. a sliding window surrounding this anchor captures both antecedent and ensuing recording, providing the researcher insight into the activities that led up to the event of interest as well as those that followed. we present themes from three deployments that leverage this technique. based on our experiences using aas, we have also developed a reusable open-source library for embedding aas into any android application.",672
To Asymmetry and Beyond!: Improving Social Connectedness by Increasing Designed Interdependence in Cooperative Play,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300239,"social play can have numerous health benefits but research has shown that not all multiplayer games are effective at promoting social engagement. asymmetric cooperative games have shown promise in this regard but the design and dynamics of this unique style of play is not yet well understood. to address this, we present the results of two player experience studies using our custom prototype game beam me 'round, scotty! 2: the first comparing symmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have the same interface, goals, mechanics, etc.) to asymmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have differing roles, abilities, interfaces, etc.) and the second comparing the effect of increasing degrees of interdependence between play partners. our results not only indicate that asymmetric cooperative games may enhance players' perceptions of connectedness, social engagement, immersion, and comfort with a game's controls, but also demonstrate how to further improve these outcomes via deliberate mechanical design changes, such as changes in cooperative action timing and direction of dependence.",673
DesignABILITY: Framework for the Design of Accessible Interactive Tools to Support Teaching to Children with Disabilities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300240,"developing educational tools aimed at children with disabilities is a challenging process for designers and developers because existing methodologies or frameworks do not provide any pedagogical information and/or do not take into account the particular needs of users with some type of impairment. in this study, we propose a framework for the design of tools to support teaching to children with disabilities. the framework provides the necessary stages for the development of tools (hardware-based or software-based) and must be adapted for a specific disability and educational goal. for this study, the framework was adapted to support literacy teaching and contributes to the design of educational/interactive technology for deaf people while making them part of the design process and taking into account their particular needs. the experts' evaluation of the framework shows that it is well structured and may be adapted for other types of disabilities.",674
Transcalibur: A Weight Shifting Virtual Reality Controller for 2D Shape Rendering based on Computational Perception Model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300241,"humans can estimate the shape of a wielded object through the illusory feeling of the mass properties of the object obtained using their hands. even though the shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (vr), it is difficult to design vr controllers for rendering desired shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and shape perception. we propose transcalibur, which is a hand-held vr controller that can render a 2d shape by changing its mass properties on a 2d planar area. we built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. this enables transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment.",675

Effects of Moderation and Opinion Heterogeneity on Attitude towards the Online Deliberation Experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300247,"online deliberation offers a way for citizens to collectively discuss an issue and provide input for policymakers. the overall experience of online deliberation can be affected by multiple factors. we decided to investigate the effects of moderation and opinion heterogeneity on the perceived deliberation experience, by running the first online deliberation experiment in singapore. our study took place in three months with three phases. in phase 1, our 2,006 participants answered a survey, that we used to create groups of different opinion heterogeneity. during the second phase, 510 participants discussed about the population issue on the online platform we developed. we gathered data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3. we found out that higher levels of moderation negatively impact the experience of deliberation on perceived procedural fairness, validity claim and policy legitimacy; and that high opinion heterogeneity is important in order to get a fair assessment of the deliberation experience.",681
MilliSonic: Pushing the Limits of Acoustic Motion Tracking,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300248,"recent years have seen interest in device tracking and localization using acoustic signals. state-of-the-art acoustic motion tracking systems however do not achieve millimeter accuracy and require large separation between microphones and speakers, and as a result, do not meet the requirements for many vr/ar applications. further, tracking multiple concurrent acoustic transmissions from vr devices today requires sacrificing accuracy or frame rate. we present millisonic, a novel system that pushes the limits of acoustic based motion tracking. our core contribution is a novel localization algorithm that can provably achieve sub-millimeter 1d tracking accuracy in the presence of multipath, while using only a single beacon with a small 4-microphone array.further, millisonic enables concurrent tracking of up to four smartphones without reducing frame rate or accuracy. our evaluation shows that millisonic achieves 0.7mm median 1d accuracy and a 2.6mm median 3d accuracy for smartphones, which is 5x more accurate than state-of-the-art systems. millisonic enables two previously infeasible interaction applications: a) 3d tracking of vr headsets using the smartphone as a beacon and b) fine-grained 3d tracking for the google cardboard vr system using a small microphone array.",682

Understanding Walking Meetings: Drivers and Barriers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376141,"there is increased interest in reducing sedentary behavior of office workers to combat the negative health effects of prolonged sitting. walking meetings offer a promising solution to this problem as they facilitate a physically active way of working. to inform future development of technologies supporting these type of meetings, in-depth qualitative insights into people's experiences of walking meetings are needed. we conducted semi-structured walking interviews (n=16) to identify key drivers and barriers for walking meetings in a living lab setting by using the 'workwalk'. the 'workwalk' is a 1.8 km walking route indicated by a dotted blue line with outdoor meeting points, integrated into the room booking system. our findings provide insights into how walking meetings are experienced and affect the set-up and social dynamics of meetings. we offer design recommendations for the development of future technologies and service design elements to support walking meetings and active ways of working.",738
Listen to Developers! A Participatory Design Study on Security Warnings for Cryptographic APIs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376142,"the positive effect of security information communicated to developers through api warnings has been established. however, current prototypical designs are based on security warnings for end-users. to improve security feedback for developers, we conducted a participatory design study with 25 professional software developers in focus groups. we identify which security information is considered helpful in avoiding insecure cryptographic api use during development. concerning console messages, participants suggested five core elements, namely message classification, title message, code location, link to detailed external resources, and color. design guidelines for end-user warnings are only partially suitable in this context. participants emphasized the importance of tailoring the detail and content of security information to the context. console warnings call for concise communication; further information needs to be linked externally. therefore, security feedback should transcend tools and should be adjustable by software developers across development tools, considering the work context and developer needs.",739

Complex and Ambiguous: Understanding Sticker Misinterpretations in Instant Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274299,"stickers, though similar in appearance to emoji, have distinct characteristics because they often contain animation, diverse gestures, and multiple characters and objects. stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. in this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in south korea. we found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. in particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. in real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction.",798
SOLVENT: A Mixed Initiative System for Finding Analogies between Research Papers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274300,"scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. to provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce solvent, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. we demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. these results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities.",799
"The Internet's Hidden Rules: An Empirical Study of Reddit Norm Violations at Micro, Meso, and Macro Scales",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274301,"norms are central to how online communities are governed. yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. in this paper, we study community norms on reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. via 2.8m comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. given the size of reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. in other words, these findings shed light on what reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. we conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities.",800
Data-Driven Proactive Policy Assurance of Post Quality in Community q&a Sites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274302,"to ensure the post quality, q&a sites usually develop a list of quality assurance guidelines for ""dos and don'ts"", and adopt collaborative editing mechanism to fix quality violations. quality guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected quality cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. our study of collaborative editing data on stack overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive quality-assurance knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network based approach to learn editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential quality issues in a post before it is posted.",801
Beyond Lingua Franca: System-Facilitated Language Switching Diversifies Participation in Multiparty Multilingual Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274303,"when multiple non-native speakers (nnss) who share the same native language join a group discussion with native speakers (nss) of the common language used in the discussion, they sometimes switch back and forth between common language and their native language to reach common ground. however, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. to offer nnss more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects a user's spoken language, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or nns's native language). in a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two japanese and two chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more participation from nnss - they increased active initiating behaviors from nnss. although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the nns pairs.",802
'Staged for Living': Negotiating Objects and their Values over a Porous Boundary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274305,"we describe more than 19 months of ethnographic fieldwork with people who have embraced minimalism, a lifestyle movement focused on reducing modern life's clutter. we found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. the home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. a porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home.",803
Crowd Coach: Peer Coaching for Crowd Workers' Skill Growth,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274306,"traditional employment usually provides mechanisms for workers to improve their skills to access better opportunities. however, crowd work platforms like amazon mechanical turk (amt) generally do not support skill development (i.e., becoming faster and better at work). while researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. however, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. to further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present crowd coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. we conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study crowd coach in the wild. hundreds of workers used crowd coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. we find that crowd coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. we posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. we finish with design implications from our research.",804
Will Too Many Editors Spoil The Tag?: Conflicts and Alignment in Q&A Categorization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274307,"q&a websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and responses. many q&as use collaborative tagging systems to improve search and discovery while distributing the work of categorizing and organization throughout the community. although early work on collaborative tagging questioned whether consistent categorization schemes could emerge from large groups with little to no coordination, empirical studies have found surprising coherence among users' tags. we build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on q&as, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). we found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict. this study highlights the importance of learning and moderation in the development of coherence in collaborative tagging systems.",805
Living in the Present: Understanding Long-Term Content Referencing in Enterprise Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274308,"successful online communities accumulate large amounts of long-term content. however there has been little quantitative, theoretically-motivated exploration of how communities organize such content, nor which community members take responsibility for active organization. we examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. we first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. we next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. we show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. we explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content.",806
Engaging with Health Data: The Interplay Between Self-Tracking Activities and Emotions in Fertility Struggles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274309,"self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",807
Spacetime Characterization of Real-Time Collaborative Editing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274310,"real-time collaborative editing (rtce) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the web. little is known in the literature yet about rtce usage patterns in the real world. in this paper we study how a popular rtce editor (etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the wikimedia foundation. the pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as ""collaborative"" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. the model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. these findings help in revisiting early rtce design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in rtce protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing).",808
Evaluating Crowdworkers as a Proxy for Online Learners in Video-Based Learning Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274311,"crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. we here report results from a crowdsourcing study (n=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and mooc learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in moocs. this serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to mooc learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. we conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities.",809
Coloring in the Links: Capturing Social Ties as They are Perceived,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274312,"the richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. the lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. we first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. these ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. we also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.",810
'Too Gay for Facebook': Presenting LGBTQ+ Identity Throughout the Personal Social Media Ecosystem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274313,"most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.",811
Score-Group Framing Negatively Impacts Peer Evaluations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274314,"how does group membership framing affect the feedback students provide learners? this paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of ingroup/outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. in the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an ingroup and outgroup peer assignment. a second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two ingroup assignments. in both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. these studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks.",812
Understanding Gender Equity in Author Order Assignment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274315,"women remain underrepresented in many fields in computer science, particularly at higher levels. in academia, success and promotion are influenced by a researcher's publication record. in many fields, including computer science, multi-author papers are the norm. evidence from other fields shows that author order norms can influence the assignment of credit. we conduct interviews of students and faculty in human-computer interaction (hci) and machine learning (ml) to determine factors related to assignment of author order in collaborative publication. the outcomes of these interviews then informed metrics of interest for a bibliometric analysis of gender and collaboration in research papers published from 1996 to 2016 in three top hci and ml conferences. based on our findings, we make recommendations for assignment of credit in multi-author papers and interpretation of author order, particularly in regard to how this area affects women.",813
Shifting Expectations: Understanding Youth Employees' Handoffs in a 3D Print Shop,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274316,"as digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3d printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in ""making"" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. the combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. however, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. we investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3d print shop during one year of field work. in this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. we then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3d prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments.",814
The Influence of Friends and Experts on Privacy Decision Making in IoT Scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274317,"as increasingly many internet-of-things (iot) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. to better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine iot data-collection scenarios. some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. at the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. our results help explain under what circumstances users are more or less likely to be swayed by the reported behavior of others in similar scenarios. for example, our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. on the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection. we also observed that influence could get stronger or wear off when participants were exposed to a sequence of scenarios. for example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed data collection in scenarios with clear risk or denied it in scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios.",815
Do Students' Learning Behaviors Differ when they Collaborate in Open-Ended Learning Environments?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274318,"researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students' collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. in this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the betty's brain system. we report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. the results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. a differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. the differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.",816
Watch Me Code: Programming Mentorship Communities on Twitch.tv,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274319,"live streaming-an emerging practice of broadcasting video of oneself in real time to an online audience-is often used by people to portray themselves engaged in a craft such as programming. viewers of these 'creative streams' gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. however, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. in this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site twitch.tv. we found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. we show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice.",817
Beyond the Coded Gaze: Analyzing Expression of Mental Health and Illness on Instagram,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274320,"in cscw and hci, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. this approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. the coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. in this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. we join manual collection of instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. we argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. we discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online.",818
'Welcome' Changes?: Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in a Wikipedia Sub-Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274321,"open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. in this study, we use the focus theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. we find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. we contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration.",819
Women (Still) Ask For Less: Gender Differences in Hourly Rate in an Online Labor Marketplace,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274322,"in many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. however, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). in this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the united states (48.8% women) on upwork, a popular gig work platform. the median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. however, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. to better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.",820

To Label or Not to Label: The Effect of Stance and Credibility Labels on Readers' Selection and Perception of News Articles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274324,"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.",822

GuessTheKarma: A Game to Assess Social Rating Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274328,"popularity systems, like twitter retweets, reddit upvotes, and pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. that, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. how much information remains? for example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item a to item b if item a had hundreds of upvotes on reddit and item b had only a few? we investigate using an internet game called guessthekarma that collects independent preference judgments (n=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, guessthekarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. overall, reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by guessthekarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. however, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. similarly, imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. we conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores.",826

Productivity in an Era of Multi-Teaming: The Role of Information Dashboards and Shared Cognition in Team Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274331,"when and why do information dashboards enhance team productivity? we explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. we expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team's transactive memory system (tms), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. to test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (knowledge worker's dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing tms; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. potential explanations and implications are discussed.",829

Bot Detection in Wikidata Using Behavioral and Other Informal Cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274333,"bots have been important to peer production's success. wikipedia, openstreetmap, and wikidata all have taken advantage of automation to perform work at a rate and scale exceeding that of human contributors. understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. we develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. we show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (pr-auc: 0.845, roc-auc: 0.985) and a qualitative analysis of ""anonymous"" contributor edit sessions. we also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities.",831
Sociocultural Practices that Make Microfinance Work: A Case Study from Sri Lanka,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274334,"microfinance is an inherently social process. over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the ""underbanked"" population in developing countries. this paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural sri lanka. through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. we also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. we contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (mfis) and technology designers. consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people.",832
Going Beyond Obscurity: Organizational Approaches to Data Anonymization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274335,"anonymization is viewed as a solution to over-exposure of personal information in a data-driven society. yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data for regulatory, ethical or commercial reasons remains underexplored. we investigate how such measures are applied in organizations, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity.",833

StressMon: Scalable Detection of Perceived Stress and Depression Using Passive Sensing of Changes in Work Routines and Group Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359139,"stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. when left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. depression can occur independently of stress. there has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. however, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. we present stressmon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the wifi infrastructure. using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. these features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. to validate stressmon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. our evaluation demonstrated stressmon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% true positive rate (tpr), an 80.76% true negative rate (tnr), and a 0.97 area under the roc curve (auc) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. in addition, stressmon was able to detect depression at 91.21% tpr, 66.71% tnr, and 0.88 auc using a 15-day window. we end by discussing how stressmon can expand cscw research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management.",857

Challenges and Design Considerations for Multimodal Asynchronous Collaboration in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359142,"studies on collaborative virtual environments (cves) have suggested capture and later replay of multimodal interactions (e.g., speech, body language, and scene manipulations), which we refer to as multimodal recordings, as an effective medium for time-distributed collaborators to discuss and review 3d content in an immersive, expressive, and asynchronous way. however, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous vr collaboration (mavrc) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. this study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing mavrc as a type of cscw and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of mavrc systems. to this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (n = 15) used an experimental mavrc system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of mavrc in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3d scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. we discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for mavrc systems.",860

Collaborative Data Work Towards a Caring Democracy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359144,"researchers in human-centered computing have surfaced a feminist ethic of care in interaction with technologies, in data collection, and in data work. drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. we employ philosopher joan tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. adding to the cscw literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. this work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. we discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. we conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small.",862
VidLyz: An Interactive Approach to Assist Novice Entrepreneurs in Making Persuasive Campaign Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359145,"videos are essential for successful crowdfunding campaigns. however, without knowledge of the underlying persuasion factors, novice entrepreneurs may find it difficult to optimize their videos for success. this paper presents vidlyz, a novel assistive tool that allows users to explore the implications of audience-engagement persuasion factors in the context of campaign videos through contrasting examples, crowd-sourced subjective ratings, and feedback on engagement factors. vidlyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. to evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype vidlyz tool. a user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. the interactive and active thinking elements of vidlyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. a follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan. we concluded with design implications to better support novice entrepreneurs.",863
Technological Frames and User Innovation: Exploring Technological Change in Community Moderation Teams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359146,management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. the successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. this paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (discord). moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on reddit. we found that moderation teams used discord's api to create scripts and bots that augmented discord to make the platform work more like tools on reddit. these tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations.,864
Causal Effects of Brevity on Style and Success in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359147,"in online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. in this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. what is the causal effect of brevity on message success? what are the linguistic traits of brevity? when is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. this allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. we find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. the optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. the observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media.",865

Information Materialities of Citizen Communication in the U.S. Congress,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359149,"in this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the u.s. congress. we work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in washington d.c. and 48 interviews with staff in the house of representatives. customer relation management systems (crms) used by congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. we find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. crms not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. this has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy.",867
Speedrunning for Charity: How Donations Gather Around a Live Streamed Couch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359150,"games done quick (gdq) is both a week-long video game speedrunning marathon and a successful charity event, raising more than $1.5 million usd in each of its past five events. to understand gdq's success as an online charity event, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with gdq speedrunners, attendees, hosts, and online viewers, analyzed past donation data, and conducted 72 hours of in-person participant observations at a live gdq event. we found that central to every gdq event is ""the couch"" which reconstructs the environment of a living room. viewers do not simply donate to support the charity or in response to the technical prowess and ingenuity of speedrunners, but to actively interact with and be part of the couch experience, the ideal social milieu of speedrunning. building upon previously identified motivations of why viewers donate to online live streamers, our work contributes to understanding how collocated gatherings can reinforce and amplify the cultural and social aspects of online subcultures (even heterogeneous ones) to encourage charitable giving. this opens opportunities for design that evoke a visceral level of engagement with charity events similar to that observed at gdq.",868
Learn2Earn: Using Mobile Airtime Incentives to Bolster Public Awareness Campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359151,"in rural parts of the developing world, spreading awareness about critical issues in health, governance, and other topics is challenging and costly. traditional media such as print, radio and tv each have limitations and offer little guarantee that new information is absorbed or retained by the target population. this paper describes learn2earn, a system that leverages mobile payments to bolster public awareness campaigns in rural india. users call an interactive voice response (ivr) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. people who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. we describe a pilot deployment of learn2earn in rural india that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. in a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that learn2earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics.",869
The Principles and Limits of Algorithm-in-the-Loop Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359152,"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.",870
The Coerciveness of the Primary Key: Infrastructure Problems in Human Services Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359153,"the premise of a primary key is simple enough: every record or row in a table should have some number or string that can uniquely identify it. primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. the technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. we conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts.",871
Computing Education for Intercultural Learning: Lessons from the Nairobi Play Project,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359154,"this paper explores computing education as a potential site for intercultural learning and encounter in post-conflict environments. it reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the nairobi play project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in kenya. while the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. we argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. we also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. we reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in cscw, ictd, and allied fields of work.",872

Dissonance Between Human and Machine Understanding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359158,"complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. it is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. in this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. in particular, we seek to answer the following questions: which (well performing) complex ml models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? how does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans.",876

Circadian Rhythms and Physiological Synchrony: Evidence of the Impact of Diversity on Small Group Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359162,"circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,""early birds"" and ""night owls""), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. we investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. we find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity.",880

Efficient Elicitation Approaches to Estimate Collective Crowd Answers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359164,"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.",882

Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359169,"online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. while past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. we characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three asian countries with their counterparts from primarily western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. while these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. we find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums.",887

Designing a Chatbot as a Mediator for Promoting Deep Self-Disclosure to a Real Mental Health Professional,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392836,"chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. one promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. as receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. however, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (mhp) through a chatbot. in this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. after using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a mhp and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the mhp. if they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the mhp, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the mhp; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the mhp through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the mhp. participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the mhp, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior.",915
Estimating Conversational Styles in Conversational Microtask Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392837,"crowdsourcing marketplaces have provided a large number of opportunities for online workers to earn a living. to improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks. the rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. there are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. to this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing.",916
The Role of Conversational Grounding in Supporting Symbiosis Between People and Digital Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392838,"in ""smart speaker'' digital assistant systems such as google home, there is no visual user interface, so people must learn about the system's capabilities and limitations by experimenting with different questions and commands. however, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. this is a problem for both the user and the system. users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. symbiosis---a mutually beneficial relationship---between ai systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. in order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users' subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. we conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the google home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. we found that the most common response from the google home, a version of ""sorry, i'm not sure how to help'', provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question. however, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. we discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants.",917
"I Share, You Care: Private Status Sharing and Sender-Controlled Notifications in Mobile Instant Messaging",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392839,"while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",918

Do Multilingual Users Prefer Chat-bots that Code-mix? Let's Nudge and Find Out!,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392846,"despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. it is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? in order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (n=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. we design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. these two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. they are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. we find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. compared to the always code-mix policy, nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. these findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style.",925

"""(We) Can Talk It Out..."": Designing for Promoting Conflict-Resolution Skills in Youth on a Moderated Minecraft Server",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392855,"online multiplayer games like minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like minecraft. however, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. broadly defined in cscw literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [easterbrook et al.,1993]). in fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[shure, 1982], [aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. while games like minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. drawing from prior literature in cscw, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated minecraft server. the online program, titled survival lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). we conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in survival lab. our research offers three key takeaways. firstly, online social games like minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. we discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work.",933
Successful Online Socialization: Lessons from the Wikipedia Education Program,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392857,"attracting and retaining newcomers is critical and challenging for online production communities such as wikipedia, both because volunteers need specialized training and are likely to leave before being integrated into the community. in response to these challenges, the wikimedia foundation started the wiki education project (wiki ed), an online program in which college students edit wikipedia articles as class assignments. the wiki ed program incorporates many components of institutional socialization, a process many conventional organizations successfully use to integrate new employees through formalized on-boarding practices. research has not adequately investigated whether wiki ed and similar programs are effective ways to integrate volunteers in online communities, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. this paper evaluates the wiki ed program by comparing 16,819 student editors in 770 wiki ed classes with new editors who joined wikipedia in the conventional way. the evaluation shows that the wiki ed students did more work, improved articles more, and were more committed to wikipedia. for example, compared to new editors who joined wikipedia in the conventional way they were twice as likely to still be editing wikipedia a year after their wiki ed class was finished. further, students in classrooms that encouraged joint activity, a key component of institutional socialization, produced better quality work than those in classrooms where students worked independently. these findings are consistent with an interpretation that the wiki ed program was successful because it incorporated elements of institutionalized socialization.",934
C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392858,"converting widely-available 2d images and videos, captured using an rgb camera, to 3d can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. however, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). a scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3d object properties. unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3d properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3d perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). in this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3d state of a single target object. our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. we evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3d location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time. our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks.",935

Quantifying the Effect of Social Presence on Online Social Conformity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392863,"social conformity occurs when individuals in group settings change their personal opinion to be in agreement with the majority's position. while recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. this study aims to understand how social presencei.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs.user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs.no discussion ), and response visibility (public vs.private ). our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self-confidence on personal answer. furthermore, we observe an interaction effect between interactivity and response visibility, such that conformity is highest in the presence of peer discussion and public responses, and lowest when these two elements are absent. we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings in designing online group settings, accounting for the effects of social presence on conformity.",939
Mitigating Exploitation: Indie Game Developers' Reconfigurations of Labor in Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392864,"much hci research seeks to contribute to technological agendas that lead to more just and participative labor relations and practices, yet that research also raises concerns about forms of exploitation associated with them. in this paper, we explore how u.s. independent [indie] game developers' socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. the research contributes to hci research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes. our critical review of indie developers' practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in cscw.",940
Unpacking Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Economy: The Impact of Shared Needs and Backgrounds on Ride-Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392865,"in recent years, the peer-to-peer economy has grown exponentially, particularly in the ride-sharing sector. this growth has been accompanied by a muddying between the sharing and gig economy, and it has become unclear when an activity is sharing a resource vs. providing a service. to unpack this difference, we studied two successful carpooling groups (university students traveling home and commuting among professionals), which we contrast with previous literature on ride-hailing apps (e.g., uber). the two communities that we studied differ in that: professionals, had more routine ride-sharing needs based on their commute; and students, arranged rides to return home for school breaks or long weekends. we detail how common needs and backgrounds impacted how carpoolers treated each other. leveraging these findings, we outline design paths for both the sharing and gig economies to better realize the ideas of the sharing economy.",941
How We've Taught Algorithms to See Identity: Constructing Race and Gender in Image Databases for Facial Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392866,"race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. what facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. in this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. we found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. we discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. we posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. we conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.",942
"It's the Wild, Wild West: Lessons Learned From IRB Members' Risk Perceptions Toward Digital Research Data",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392868,"digital technology that is prevalent in people's everyday lives, including smart home devices, mobile apps and social media, increasingly lack regulations for how the user data can be collected, used or disseminated. the cscw and the larger computing community continue to evaluate and understand the potential negative impacts of research involving digital technologies. as more research involves digital data, institutional review boards (irbs) take on the difficult task of evaluating and determining risks--likelihood of potential harms--from digital research. learning more about irbs' role in concretizing harm and its likelihood will help us critically examine the current approach to regulating digital research, and has implications for how researchers can reflect on their own data practices. we interviewed 22 u.s.-based irb members and found that, for the interviewees, ""being digital"" added a risk. being digital meant increasing possibilities of confidentiality breach, unintended collection of sensitive information, and unauthorized data reuse. concurrently, interviewees found it difficult to pinpoint the direct harms that come out of those risks. the ambiguous, messy, and situated contexts of digital research data did not fit neatly into current human subjects research protection protocols. we discuss potential solutions for understanding risks and harms of digital technology and implications for the responsibilities of the cscw and the larger computing community in conducting digital research.",943
Privacy-Preserving Script Sharing in GUI-based Programming-by-Demonstration Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392869,"an important concern in end user development (eud) is accidentally embedding personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. this issue is particularly important in gui-based programming-by-demonstration (pbd) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in eud. we present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential personal information in gui-based pbd scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app gui context. compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields.",944
Supporting Storytelling With Evidence in Holistic Review Processes: A Participatory Design Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392870,"review processes involve complex and often subjective decision-making tasks in which individual reviewers must read and rate submissions, such as a college application, along many relevant dimensions and typically with a rubric in mind. a common part of the work is committee review, where individual reviewers meet to discuss the merits of a particular submission in order to recommend an accept or reject decision. prior work indicates that visualization and sensemaking support may be beneficial in such processes where reviewers must present the ""story"" of the applicant under question. we conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling. based on these workshops, we contribute a characterization for how reviewers in this domain construct visual stories, we provide guidance for designing for evidence capture and storytelling, and we draw parallels and distinctions between this domain and other reviewing domains.",945
Configuring Audiences: A Case Study of Email Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392871,"when people communicate with each other, their choice of what to say is tied to their perceptions of the audience. for many communication channels, people have some ability to explicitly specify their audience members and the different roles they can play. while existing accounts of communication behavior have largely focused on how people tailor the content of their messages, we focus on the configuring of the audience as a complementary family of decisions in communication. we formulate a general description of audience configuration choices, highlighting key aspects of the audience that people could configure to reflect a range of communicative goals. we then illustrate these ideas via a case study of email usage-a realistic domain where audience configuration choices are particularly fine-grained and explicit in how email senders fill the to and cc address fields. in a large collection of enterprise emails, we explore how people configure their audiences, finding salient patterns relating a sender's choice of configuration to the types of participants in the email exchange, the content of the message, and the nature of the subsequent interactions. our formulation and findings show how analyzing audience configurations can enrich and extend existing accounts of communication behavior, and frame research directions on audience configuration decisions in communication and collaboration.",946
"Using Cultural Probes in HCI4D/ICTD: A Design Case Study from Bungoma, Kenya",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392873,"cultural probes have long been used in hci to provide designers with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are designing, and thereby inspire novel design proposals. hci4d/ictd researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new design approaches. however, few use this subjective, design-led method in their research. in this paper, i present a case study detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes in bungoma, kenya. returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities draw attention to probe recipients' unique experiences and to bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. my experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural probes approach can benefit hci4d/ictd research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. more broadly, i offer a case study demonstrating an alternative way to approach design in hci4d/ictd.",947
Exposing Error in Poverty Management Technology: A Method for Auditing Government Benefits Screening Tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392874,"public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. in the us, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. if incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. we introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. we illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process.",948
Learning from Tweets: Opportunities and Challenges to Inform Policy Making During Dengue Epidemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392875,"social media platforms are widely used by people to report, access, and share information during outbreaks and epidemics. although government agencies and healthcare institutions in developed regions are increasingly relying on social media to develop epidemic forecasts and outbreak response, there is a limited understanding of how people in developing regions interact on social media during outbreaks and what useful insights this dataset could offer during public health crises. in this work, we examined 28,688 tweets to identify public health issues during dengue epidemic in bangladesh and found several insights, such as irregularities in dengue diagnosis and treatment, shortage of blood supply for rh negative blood groups, and high local transmission of dengue during eid-ul-adha, that impact disease preparedness and outbreak response. we discuss the opportunities and challenges in analyzing tweets and outline how government agencies and healthcare institutions can use social media health data to inform policy making during public health crises.",949
MAMAS: Supporting Parent--Child Mealtime Interactions Using Automated Tracking and Speech Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392876,"many parents of young children find it challenging to deal with their children's eating problems, and parent--child mealtime interaction is fundamental in forming children's healthy eating habits. in this paper, we present the results of a three-week study through which we deployed a mealtime assistant application, mamas, for monitoring parent--child mealtime conversation and food intake with 15 parent--child pairs. our findings indicate that the use of mamas helped 1) increase children's autonomy during mealtime, 2) enhance parents' self-awareness of their words and behaviors, 3) promote the parent--child relationship, and 4) positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. the study also revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. based on the findings, we discuss how a mealtime assistant application can be better designed for parents and children with challenging eating behaviors.",950
Parallel Worlds: Repeated Initializations of the Same Team to Improve Team Viability,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392877,"a team's early interactions are influential: small behaviors cascade, driving the team either toward successful collaboration or toward fracture. would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? we introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. in two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world. our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot - and stay there.",951
"Human Factors in Model Interpretability: Industry Practices, Challenges, and Needs",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392878,"as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",952
Decolonizing Tactics as Collective Resilience: Identity Work of AAPI Communities on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392881,"asian american and pacific islander (aapi) communities use online platforms like reddit to build capacity for resilience from white hegemony. we conduct interviews with 21 moderators of aapi subreddits to understand how sociotechnical systems contour and contribute to the marginalization of online communities. we examine marginalization through the analytic framework of decolonization and uncover the threats and tactics that aapi redditors encounter and employ to decolonize their collective identity. we find that moderators of aapi subreddits develop collective resilience within their online communities by reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. we describe how algorithmic configurations within sociotechnical systems reaffirm existing hegemonic values and discuss how users and designers of sociotechnical systems may work toward resisting white hegemony.",953
DreamCatcher: Exploring How Parents and School-Age Children can Track and Review Sleep Information Together,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392882,"parents and their school-age children can impact one another's sleep. most sleep-tracking tools, however, are designed for adults and make it difficult for parents and children to track together. to examine how to design a family-centered sleep tracking tool, we designed dreamcatcher. dreamcatcher is an in-home, interactive, shared display that aggregates data from wrist-worn sleep sensors and self-reported mood. we deployed dreamcatcher as a probe to examine the design space of tracking sleep as a family. ten families participated in the study probe between 15 and 50 days. this study uses a family systems perspective to explore research questions regarding the feasibility of children actively tracking health data alongside their parents and the effects of tracking and sharing on family dynamics. our results indicate that children can be active tracking contributors and that having parents and children track together encourages turn-taking and working together. however, there were also moments when family members, in particular parents, felt discomfort from sharing their sleep and mood with other family members. our research contributes to a growing understanding of designing family centered health-informatics tools to support the combined needs of parents and children.",954

Can you Turn it Off?: The Spatial and Social Context of Mobile Disturbance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415162,"contemporary mobile devices continuously interrupt people with notifications in various and changing physical environments. as different places can have different social setting, understanding how disturbing an interruption might be to people around the user is not a straightforward task. to understand how users perceive disturbance in their social environment, we analyze the results of a 3-week user study with 50 participants using the experience sampling method and log analysis. we show that perceptions of disturbance are strongly related to the social norms surrounding the place, such as whether the place is considered private or public, even when controlling for the number of people around the user. furthermore, users' perceptions of disturbance are also related to the activity carried out on the phone, and the subjective perceptions of isolation from other people in the space. we conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design new mobile devices that are aware of the social norms and their users' environmental context.",956
Hate begets Hate: A Temporal Study of Hate Speech,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415163,"with the ongoing debate on 'freedom of speech' vs. 'hate speech,' there is an urgent need to carefully understand the consequences of the inevitable culmination of the two, i.e., 'freedom of hate speech' over time. an ideal scenario to understand this would be to observe the effects of hate speech in an (almost) unrestricted environment. hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. we first generate temporal snapshots of gab from millions of posts and users. using these temporal snapshots, we compute an activity vector based on degroot model to identify hateful users. the amount of hate speech in gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hateful at an increased and faster rate. further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the gab network. also, the language used by the community as a whole seem to correlate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones. we discuss how, many crucial design questions in cscw open up from our work.",957
"Investigating Differences in Crowdsourced News Credibility Assessment: Raters, Tasks, and Expert Criteria",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415164,"misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. the crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. in this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. we gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and upwork workers---as well as 2 expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. from these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.",958
From Virtual Strangers to IRL Friends: Relationship Development in Livestreaming Communities on Twitch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415165,"accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic ""crowdroar"" offered in some channels to the close-knit, ""participatory communities"" within others. what kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types of meaningful conversation and connection that support relationship development, and how? in this paper, we explore how personal relationships develop within twitch, a popular livestreaming service. interviews with 21 pairs who met initially within twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. consistent with walther's hyperpersonal model, these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. as group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. findings from a survey of 1,367 members of twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. together, these findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. we consider implications for the design and management of online communities, including their potential for supporting ""strong bridges,"" relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and network bridges.",959
Exploring Design Principles for Sharing of Personal Informatics Data on Ephemeral Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415166,"people often do not receive the engagement or responses they desire when they share on broad social media platforms. sharers are hesitant to share trivial accomplishments, and the emphasis on data often results posts that audiences find repetitive or unengaging. ephemeral social media's focus on self-authored content and sharing trivial accomplishments has the potential to ameliorate these challenges. we explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. we examine the effect of a sticker's presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants. we uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make ephemeral content more informative and entertaining, discussing implications for platforms and tools.",960
Human-AI Collaboration in a Cooperative Game Setting: Measuring Social Perception and Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415167,"human-ai interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. in this paper, we investigate human-ai collaboration in the context of a collaborative ai-driven word association game with partially observable information. in our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an ai or with a human. we also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. we ran a large scale study on mechanical turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an ai partner. we also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss ai agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-ai collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-ai interaction and communication.",961
Using the Crowd to Prevent Harmful AI Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415168,"to prevent harmful ai behavior, people need to specify constraints that forbid undesirable actions. unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations. therefore, such decisions have historically been made by a small group of powerful ai companies and developers, with limited community input. in this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of non-ai experts to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to ai systems. we first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of ai behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants tend to adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection. next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge. we test our approaches on a real-world ai problem in the domain of education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency. we also demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world ai problems (e.g. in social networks).",962
Life Review Using a Life Metaphoric Game to Promote Intergenerational Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415169,"this study explores whether a life metaphoric game can effectively facilitate communication between senior participants and young adult partners during a life review activity. life review provides older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences, rediscover the meaning of life, and prepare for their future life and eventual death. we held workshops in which 33 senior participants (ages 51-85) co-played a commercial game, titled ""long journey of life,"" paired with young adult partners (ages 19-23). the young partners asked senior participants about their associated memories during the life review activity. through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication themes during the life review activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation, life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclosure, interpretation of metaphors, and explanation of game control methods. we investigated the relationships between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. in addition, we identified how participants' responses to the game differ depending on the player's characteristics and generation. game design suggestions for an effective intergenerational life review using digital games were offered.",963
Understanding the Homepreneurship Opportunities Afforded by Social Networking and Personal Fabrication Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415170,"the decreased cost and increased usability of personal fabrication technologies has enabled a new generation of crafters to integrate digital designs and computationally created artifacts into physically-based practices. with the simultaneous ubiquity of e-commerce and social networking channels, these technologies have enabled many crafters to transform their hobbies into home-based businesses. to understand the opportunities and challenges that fusing social networking platforms, personal fabrication equipment, and e-commerce have afforded these homepreneurs, an online survey and follow-up interviews were conducted with crafters who use hobbyist cutting plotters to personalize and sell goods online. the findings uncovered an emerging group of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, who use these technologies for supplemental income for their families and highlighted the emotional and opportunistic benefits that such personalized, at-home manufacturing affords. they also highlighted the workflows and lifestyle implications of using these technologies to run home-based businesses, the multi-faceted usage and dependence these homepreneurs have on online social platforms such as facebook, the complex software toolchains that are used, and the commonplace practice of appropriating designs from others that occurs in this community.",964
Wikipedia Edit-a-thons as Sites of Public Pedagogy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415171,"wikipedia edit-a-thon events provide a targeted approach toward incorporating new knowledge into the online encyclopedia while also offering pathways toward new editor participation. through the analysis of interviews with 13 edit-a-thon facilitators, however, we find motivations for running edit-a-thons extend far beyond adding content and editors. in this paper, we uncover how a range of personal and institutional values inspire these event facilitators toward fulfilling broader goals including fostering information literacy and establishing community relationships outside of wikipedia. along with reporting motivations, values, and goals, we also describe strategies facilitators adopt in their practice. next, we discuss challenges faced by facilitators as they organize edit-a-thons. we situate our findings within two complementary theoretical lenses-information ecologies and public pedagogy to guide our interpretation. finally, we suggest new ways in which edit-a-thons, as well as similar peer production events and communities, can be understood, studied, and evaluated.",965
Informational Friction as a Lens for Studying Algorithmic Aspects of Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415172,"this paper addresses challenges in conceptualizing privacy posed by algorithmic systems that can infer sensitive information from seemingly innocuous data. this type of privacy is of imminent concern due to the rapid adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in virtually every industry. in this paper, we suggest informational friction, a concept from floridi's ethics of information, as a valuable conceptual lens for studying algorithmic aspects of privacy. informational friction describes the amount of work required for one agent to access or alter the information of another. by focusing on amount of work, rather than the type of information or manner in which it is collected, informational friction can help to explain why automated analyses should raise privacy concerns independently of, and in addition to, those associated with data collection. as a demonstration, this paper analyze law enforcement use of facial recognition, andfacebook's targeted advertising model using informational friction and demonstrate risks inherent to these systems which are not completely identified in another popular framework, nissenbaum's contextual integrity.the paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications, both for privacy research and for privacy regulation.",966
Mediating Community-AI Interaction through Situated Explanation: The Case of AI-Led Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415173,"artificial intelligence (ai) has become prevalent in our everyday technologies and impacts both individuals and communities. the explainable ai (xai) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. in addition, existing xai research tends to focus on the individual level. little is known about how people understand and explain ai-led decisions in the community context. drawing from xai and activity theory, a foundational hci theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-ai interaction. we then present a case study of ai-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of ai-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of cscw, hci, and xai.",967
"Spontaneous, Yet Studious: Esports Commentators' Live Performance and Self-Presentation Practices",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415174,"esports commentating, the practice of reporting, explaining, and elaborating live competitive gameplay to spectators, is a centerpiece of esports as a rapidly growing spectator sport and an essential component of today's growing gaming/live streaming ecosystem. in particular, esports commentators face three unique challenges: the preparation for conducting real time commentating on highly dynamic esports games; the complexity of in-the-moment decisions during the game's broadcast; and the balance between personal self-presentation and professional content presentation. yet this emerging and novel sociotechnical practice and how these challenges affect esports commentators' live performance and self-presentation practices has received relatively little research attention in hci and cscw. in this paper, we endeavor to address these limitations by empirically analyzing 19 esports commentators' sociotechnical practices. our findings highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating as well as the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators' self-presentation. in order to execute seamless and spontaneous commentary, commentators must be studious and engage in much prior research and have a clear sense of self. we contribute to the growing cscw literature on esports commentating practices by revealing esports commentators' unique decision making process presenting information and their self-image.",968
"Party Politics, Values and the Design of Social Media Services: Implications of political elites' values and ideologies to mitigating of political polarisation through design",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415175,"there have been several attempts to support political engagement through novel social media services. while the political nature of any technologies is widely acknowledged in human-computer interaction, such considerations have been less studied when designing for political engagement in social media services. we used speculative design probes to gauge how political elites perceive alternative social media interfaces designed to increase media diversity and decrease political polarisation. we show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. our underlying contribution is wider. we show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media.",969

Leveraging Peer Support for Mature Immigrants Learning to Write in Informal Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415177,"for adult newcomers to countries such as canada, learning language is more than an academic task. language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. to explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in english, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. we discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities.",971
Reconsidering Self-Moderation: the Role of Research in Supporting Community-Based Models for Online Content Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415178,"research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like wikipedia, facebook groups, and reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like twitter and instagram. in this work i review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for researchers studying community self-moderation. i contrast community-based moderation research with platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. i provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion.",972
Exploring Antecedents and Consequences of Toxicity in Online Discussions: A Case Study on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415179,"toxicity in online discussions has been an intriguing phenomenon and an important problem. in this paper, we seek to better understand toxicity dynamics in online discussions via a case study on reddit that explores the antecedents and consequences of toxicity in text. we inspected two dimensions of toxicity: language toxicity, i.e. how toxic the text itself is; and toxicity elicitation, i.e. how much toxicity it elicits in its response. through regression analyses on reddit comments, we found that both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context were strong positive antecedents of language toxicity; meanwhile, language toxicity significantly increased the volume and user evaluation of the discussion in some sub-communities, while toxicity elicitation showed mixed effects. we then discuss how our results help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions by interpreting the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity.",973
Supporting Youth Activists? Strategic Use of Social Media: A Qualitative Investigation of Design Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415180,"social networking sites (sns) provide a platform for engaging youth in activism (e.g., by helping mobilize civic action). while youth typically employ casual approaches to online activism (i.e., quick actions, such as broadcast posts to advertise social justice events), more strategic practices (i.e., those that are more creative and informed) can increase the likelihood of successful online campaigns. however, little work has examined how youth activists can be supported to use sns more strategically. to address this research gap, we conducted interviews with youth activists, exploring how youth made sense of social network visualizations and their perspectives on how such tools could support their activism efforts. our findings characterize how participants made inferences about followers? identities based on their hashtag use, and how they used those inferences in outreach decisions. we conclude with design implications for future research in this area.",974
CrowdCog: A Cognitive Skill based System for Heterogeneous Task Assignment and Recommendation in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415181,"while crowd workers typically complete a variety of tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, there is no widely accepted method to successfully match workers to different types of tasks. researchers have considered using worker demographics, behavioural traces, and prior task completion records to optimise task assignment. however, optimum task assignment remains a challenging research problem due to limitations of proposed approaches, which in turn can have a significant impact on the future of crowdsourcing. we present 'crowdcog', an online dynamic system that performs both task assignment and task recommendations, by relying on fast-paced online cognitive tests to estimate worker performance across a variety of tasks. our work extends prior work that highlights the effect of workers' cognitive ability on crowdsourcing task performance. our study, deployed on amazon mechanical turk, involved 574 workers and 983 hits that span across four typical crowd tasks (classification, counting, transcription, and sentiment analysis). our results show that both our assignment method and recommendation method result in a significant performance increase (5% to 20%) as compared to a generic or random task assignment. our findings pave the way for the use of quick cognitive tests to provide robust recommendations and assignments to crowd workers.",975
Sochiatrist: Signals of Affect in Messaging Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415182,"messaging is a common mode of communication, with conversations written informally between individuals. interpreting emotional affect from messaging data can lead to a powerful form of reflection or act as a support for clinical therapy. existing analysis techniques for social media commonly use liwc and vader for automated sentiment estimation. we correlate liwc, vader, and ratings from human reviewers with affect scores from 25 participants. we explore differences in how and when each technique is successful. results show that human review does better than vader, the best automated technique, when humans are judging positive affect ($r_s=0.45$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.30$ overall). surprisingly, human reviewers only do slightly better than vader when judging negative affect ($r_s=0.38$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.29$ overall). compared to prior literature, vader correlates more closely with panas scores for private messaging than public social media. our results indicate that while any technique that serves as a proxy for panas scores has moderate correlation at best, there are some areas to improve the automated techniques by better considering context and timing in conversations.",976
The Patient Advice System: A Technology Probe Study to Enable Peer Support in the Hospital,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415183,"although peer support technologies are critical resources for patients managing health conditions, they do not address the needs of patients in the hospital (i.e., inpatients) or the unique design constraints of this healthcare setting. to examine how the design of these technologies can meet the needs of inpatients, we conducted a technology probe study with 30 pediatric and adult inpatients. we created the patient advice system (pas) to enable peer support in the hospital setting, then studied how participants used and perceived it during their stay. inpatients used the pas to exchange emotional support and share peer advice on a range of topics (e.g., adjusting to the hospital, communicating with providers). they identified several benefits (e.g., fostered connections) and challenges (e.g., competing clinical priorities) with using the pas in the real-world context of their hospital stay. based on our findings, we discuss three design opportunities-highlighting local expertise, designing for dynamic engagement, and providing alternative modes of peer support-for future peer support technologies to empower inpatients and overcome the difficulties they face within the hospital.",977

Tangible Privacy: Towards User-Centric Sensor Designs for Bystander Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415187,"sensor-enabled computers in the form of 'iot' devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. with the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to ""turn the camera off""), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. with the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. to understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with iot devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current iot devices. we find that although participants' behaviors line up with altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with iot devices. we argue that iot devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders.",981
A Seat at the Table: Black Feminist Thought as a Critical Framework for Inclusive Game Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415188,"game-based second language (l2) learning represents an ideal alternative to foreign language classroom instruction. however, despite a diverse player demographic, the design of l2 games is often not informed by players representative of marginalized populations, especially women of color (i.e., black women). such oversight in the design process contributes to games that perpetuate gendered and racist stereotypes, and therefore, are less appealing to women of color. in response this dilemma, we utilize black feminist thought (bft) as a critical framework to engage black women, a marginalized and understudied population within the gaming subculture, and more broadly, the computer supported cooperative work (cscw) community in game design. twenty-five black women take on multiple roles as game designers, foreign language instructor, and informants who represent both producers and consumers throughout the conceptualization phase of a l2 mobile game prototype. applying bft principles, we leverage black women\textquotesingle s lived intersectional experiences to transform the traditional game design process into a more inclusive design experience for black women. in the context of games that support l2 learning, our findings reveal that black women appreciate games that: 1. provide authentic cultural experiences; 2. feature intersectional game characters that reflect real life experiences; 3. accurately portray the diversity of black women's bodies; and 4. provide opportunities for players to customize game assets. as a disruptor to traditional game design, bft makes salient oppressive design practices within the gaming culture that also extend to the larger cscw community, signifying the need to embrace more inclusive design practices that benefit black women and other marginalized populations.",982

Advisory Service Support that Works: Enhancing Service Quality with a Mixed-reality System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415191,"modern information technology promises to improve service encounters through automated documentation or better decision traceability. at the same time, research suggests a negative impact of technology on human-to-human advisory services: including the possibility that computers might degrade the quality of interpersonal communication and reinforce unpleasant behaviors. consequently, despite obvious improvements, information technology might have a negative impact on how the participants perceive the service. this might imply serious consequences for the service provider: dissatisfied clients, ineffective information exchange, and/or lack of transparency. this scenario slows down the diffusion of computers into advisory services in banks and insurance companies, and so designing systems for use in interpersonal services remains a challenge. this article provides evidence that livepaper, a system designed alongside the material practices of a financial advisory encounter, helps to improve important service quality dimensions, making the services not only more pleasant for the participants, but also improving key marketing and business metrics of the service. in experimental advisory services, the sessions supported with livepaper outperformed conventional services with regard to overall bank service quality and satisfaction, salesperson listening and interaction rating scores, as well as information transparency. this shows that a carefully designed system not only preserves the perceived quality of a service, but might improve it objectively, and has implications for the marketing and business value of the service.",985
Middle-Aged Video Consumers' Beliefs About Algorithmic Recommendations on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415192,"user beliefs about algorithmic systems are constantly co-produced through user interaction and the complex socio-technical systems that generate recommendations. identifying these beliefs is crucial because they influence how users interact with recommendation algorithms. with no prior work on user beliefs of algorithmic video recommendations, practitioners lack relevant knowledge to improve the user experience of such systems. to address this problem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with middle-aged youtube video consumers to analyze their user beliefs about the video recommendation system. our analysis revealed different factors that users believe influence their recommendations. based on these factors, we identified four groups of user beliefs: previous actions, social media, recommender system, and company policy. additionally, we propose a framework to distinguish the four main actors that users believe influence their video recommendations: the current user, other users, the algorithm, and the organization. this framework provides a new lens to explore design suggestions based on the agency of these four actors. it also exposes a novel aspect previously unexplored: the effect of corporate decisions on the interaction with algorithmic recommendations. while we found that users are aware of the existence of the recommendation system on youtube, we show that their understanding of this system is limited.",986

Religion and Sustainability: Lessons of Sustainable Computing from Islamic Religious Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415199,"while persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. this criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. we join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. based on our six-month long ethnography with the islamic communities in a bangladeshi city, kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. we further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of cscw literature in the various domains.",993
Sociocultural Dimensions of Tracking Health and Taking Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415200,"the field of personal health informatics has received increasing attention within the cscw and hci communities as health tracking becomes more affordable, accessible, and pervasive. chronic disease management, in particular, presents tremendous potential for intervention given patients' ability to now actively participate in their care through tracking. the focus on 'personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. to dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in bangalore, india. in this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. we then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health.",994
"Combating Misinformation in Bangladesh: Roles and Responsibilities as Perceived by Journalists, Fact-checkers, and Users",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415201,"there has been a growing interest within cscw community in understanding the characteristics of misinformation propagated through computational media, and the devising techniques to address the associated challenges. however, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the global south. this paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of bangladesh, a country in the global south. the spread of misinformation on facebook in bangladesh, a country with a population of over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. by interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in bangladesh. our findings show that most people in the 'news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online. however, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being published online every day. we further find that the voluntary fact-checkers in bangladesh are not equipped with sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. we show how our findings are connected to some of the core concerns of cscw community around social media, collaboration, infrastructural politics, and information inequality. from our analysis, we also suggest several pathways to increase the impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design, and infrastructure development.",995
Quantifying the Causal Effects of Conversational Tendencies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415202,"understanding what leads to effective conversations can aid the design of better computer-mediated communication platforms. in particular, prior observational work has sought to identify behaviors of individuals that correlate to their conversational efficiency. however, translating such correlations to causal interpretations is a necessary step in using them in a prescriptive fashion to guide better designs and policies. in this work, we formally describe the problem of drawing causal links between conversational behaviors and outcomes. we focus on the task of determining a particular type of policy for a text-based crisis counseling platform: how best to allocate counselors based on their behavioral tendencies exhibited in their past conversations. we apply arguments derived from causal inference to underline key challenges that arise in conversational settings where randomized trials are hard to implement. finally, we show how to circumvent these inference challenges in our particular domain, and illustrate the potential benefits of an allocation policy informed by the resulting prescriptive information.",996
CrowdCO-OP: Sharing Risks and Rewards in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415203,"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.",997

Food Aid Technology: The Experience of a Syrian Refugee Community in Coping with Food Insecurity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415205,"over half of syrian refugee households in lebanon are food insecure with some reliant on an electronic voucher (e-voucher) system for food aid. the interplay between the digitisation of food aid, within the socio-technical context of refugees, and community collaborative practices is yet to be investigated. through design engagements and interviews with refugees and shop owners we explore the experiences of a syrian refugee community in lebanon using the e-voucher system. we provide insights into the socio-technical environment in which the e-voucher system is dispensing aid, the information and power asymmetries experienced, refugee collaborative coping practices and how they interplay with the e-voucher system. we highlight the need for: (1) expanding refugee digital capabilities to encompass understandings of aid technologies and identifying trusted intermediaries and (2) for technologies to support in upholding humanitarian principles and mitigating power and information asymmetries. lastly, we call for cscw researchers and humanitarian innovators to consider how humanitarian technologies can enable refugee collaborative practices and adopt everyday security as a lens for designing aid technologies. the paper contributes to cscw knowledge regarding the interplay between aid technologies and refugees? socio-technical contexts and practices that provides a basis for future technological designs for collaborative technologies for refugee food security.",999
Collecting the Public Perception of AI and Robot Rights,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415206,"whether to give rights to artificial intelligence (ai) and robots has been a sensitive topic since the european parliament proposed advanced robots could be granted ""electronic personalities."" numerous scholars who favor or disfavor its feasibility have participated in the debate. this paper presents an experiment (n=1270) that 1) collects online users' first impressions of 11 possible rights that could be granted to autonomous electronic agents of the future and 2) examines whether debunking common misconceptions on the proposal modifies one's stance toward the issue. the results indicate that even though online users mainly disfavor ai and robot rights, they are supportive of protecting electronic agents from cruelty (i.e., favor the right against cruel treatment). furthermore, people's perceptions became more positive when given information about rights-bearing non-human entities or myth-refuting statements. the style used to introduce ai and robot rights significantly affected how the participants perceived the proposal, similar to the way metaphors function in creating laws. for robustness, we repeated the experiment over a more representative sample of u.s. residents (n=164) and found that perceptions gathered from online users and those by the general population are similar.",1000
Effects of Shared Gaze on Audio- Versus Text-Based Remote Collaborations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415207,"remote collaborations are becoming ubiquitous, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. however, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. this paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. we find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators.",1001
Supporting Women in Online Dating with a Messaging Interface that Improves their Face-to-Face Meeting Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415208,"this paper presents a study of a messaging interface prototype for online dating intended to improve women's face-to-face meeting decisions, and therefore the capacity to manage the gendered risks involved with such meetings. the interface prompts users with discussion topics that are potentially more valuable for user evaluation than the impression management-motivated topics often chosen by men. these topics come in the form of first-date scenarios that messaging partners either agree or disagree on. through a mixed-methods study utilizing speed dating events, daters used the interface to interact before meeting face-to-face. results indicate that women's face-to-face meeting decisions improve when the interface prompts them to discuss scenarios involving agreement of opinion. men's decisions are worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to the displayed agreement being misinterpreted as a signal of compatibility. the study ultimately stresses that designs intended for women, and at-risk groups more broadly, must also be assessed with other user demographics-namely those that pose a risk-to identify unforeseen implications.",1002
"""Am I doing this all wrong?"": Challenges and Opportunities in Family Information Management",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415209,"running a household requires a large amount of labor, from ensuring multiple bills are paid to organizing important documents. failure to manage such information can have critical consequences for the financial and psychological well-being of the family; however, little is known about how families manage the full scale of information encountered in the home. in this paper, we introduce family information management (fim) as a set of overarching practices involved in managing and coordinating household-related information. to understand how families engage in fim, we conducted in-depth interviews with members of ten families, which included guided tours of their information archives. we found that families struggle to organize, store, retrieve, and share information, and that there are significant socioemotional costs to this work. we propose opportunities for designing technologies to support fim and argue that, given the numerous challenges and unmet needs, the understudied area of fim deserves further investment of research and design efforts.",1003
Implicit Diversity in Image Summarization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415210,"studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. this skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. for example, kay et al. showed that although 28% of ceos in the u.s. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""ceo"" in google image search are women. similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. these labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. however, such labels are often unknown. further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. as observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. we develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. the goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. it accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. we provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known mmr algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. we evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known celeba dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current google image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. these empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.",1004
Countering Fake News: A Comparison of Possible Solutions Regarding User Acceptance and Effectiveness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415211,"since the emergence of so-called fake news on the internet and in social media, platforms such as facebook have started to take countermeasures, and researchers have begun looking into this phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. a large number of scientific work has investigated ways to detect fake news automatically. less attention has been paid to the subsequent step, i.e., what to do when you are aware of the inaccuracy of claims in social media. this work takes a user-centered approach on means to counter identified mis- and disinformation in social media. we conduct a three-step study design on how approaches in social media should be presented to respect the users' needs and experiences and how effective they are. as our first step, in an online survey representative for some factors to the german adult population, we enquire regarding their strategies on handling information in social media, and their opinion regarding possible solutions --- focusing on the approach of displaying a warning on inaccurate posts. in a second step, we present five potential approaches for countermeasures identified in related work to interviewees for qualitative input. we discuss (1) warning, (2) related articles, (3) reducing the size, (4) covering, and (5) requiring confirmation. based on the interview feedback, as the third step of this study, we select, improve, and examine four promising approaches on how to counter misinformation. we conduct an online experiment to test their effectiveness on the perceived accuracy of false headlines and also ask for the users' preferences. in this study, we find that users welcome warning-based approaches to counter fake news and are somewhat critical with less transparent methods. moreover, users want social media platforms to explain why a post was marked as disputed. the results regarding effectiveness are similar: warning-based approaches are shown to be effective in reducing the perceived accuracy of false headlines. moreover, adding an explanation to the warning leads to the most significant results. in contrast, we could not find a significant effect on one of facebook's current approaches (reduced post size and fact-checks in related articles).",1005
"'Yes, I comply!': Motivations and Practices around Research Data Management and Reuse across Scientific Fields",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415212,"as science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the requirements for comprehensive research data management (rdm) grow. this often overwhelms scientists, requiring more workload and training. the failure to conduct effective rdm leads to producing research artefacts that cannot be reproduced or reused. past research placed high value on supporting data science workers, but focused mainly on data production, collection, processing, and sensemaking. in order to understand practices and needs of data science workers in relation to documentation, preservation, sharing, and reuse, we conducted a cross-domain study with 15 scientists and data managers from diverse scientific domains. we identified five core concepts which describe requirements, drivers, and boundaries in the development of commitment for rdm, essential for generating reproducible research artefacts: practice, adoption, barriers, education, and impact. based on those concepts, we introduce a stage-based model of personal rdm commitment evolution. the model can be used to drive the design of future systems that support a transition to open science. we discuss infrastructure, policies, and motivations involved at the stages and transitions in the model. our work supports designers in understanding the constraints and challenges involved in designing for reproducibility in an age of data-driven science.",1006
Mobile Collocated Gaming: Collaborative Play and Meaning-Making on a University Campus,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415213,"many mobile games are designed to be placeless, so that mobile device owners could play anytime, anywhere. but does such design erase the sense of place in mobile gaming? to investigate the spatiality of mobile gaming, we conducted an ethnographic study of mobile gaming in a chinese university. we found mobile gaming as a form of collocated interaction, where participants collectively created meanings around distinctive places on the campus including dormitory, classroom, and laboratory, and engaged in collaborative play. their mobile collocated gaming was shaped by the social, organizational, and cultural contexts of places. the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming entails both appropriation of the norms and expectations of places and creation of new meanings to negotiate tensions between mobile gaming and places. we further discuss the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming and broader social and cultural conditions.",1007
Are You One of Us?: Current Hiring Practices Suggest the Potential for Class Biases in Large Tech Companies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415214,"to better understand how we can broaden participation in computing, this exploratory study examines the interview process for elite internships at established technology companies. through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. these evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. by reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. we conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process.",1008
A Framework for Understanding the Relationship between Social Media Discourse and Mental Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415215,"over 35% of the world's population uses social media. platforms like facebook, twitter, and instagram have radically influenced the way individuals interact and communicate. these platforms facilitate both public and private communication with strangers and friends alike, providing rich insight into an individual's personality, health, and wellbeing. to date, many researchers have employed a variety of methods for extracting mental health-centric features from digital text communication (dtc) data, including natural language processing, social network analysis, and extraction of temporal discourse patterns. however, none have explored a hierarchical framework for extracting features from private messages with the goal of unifying approaches across methodological domains. furthermore, while analyses of large, public corpora abound in existing literature, limited work has been done to explore the relationship between of private textual communications, personality traits, and symptoms of mental illness. we present a framework for constructing rich feature spaces from digital text communications. we then demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by applying it to a dataset of private facebook messages in a college student population (n=103). our results reveal key individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as language usage in relation to validated measures of trait-level anxiety, loneliness, and personality. this work represents a critical step forward in linking features of private social media messages to validated measures of mental health, wellbeing, and personality.",1009
What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects?: Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415216,"time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. while research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. while case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. while short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.",1010

Intersectional AI: A Study of How Information Science Students Think about Ethics and Their Impact,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415218,"recent literature has demonstrated the limited and, in some instances, waning role of ethical training in computing classes in the us. the capacity for artificial intelligence (ai) to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it's an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. the question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing ai, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction?from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice, to public benefits distribution and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. the us is a mecca of information and computer science (is and cs) learning for asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds ai bias. our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design ai systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that heighten risk for vulnerable groups. in this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an ai class and 9 from a data mining class. we find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of ai design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. when they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of ai. while they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy 'work.' notably, the students who more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias, and the interaction with context. our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about ai, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into is and cs curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course.",1012

Seeing in Context: Traditional Visual Communication Practices in Rural Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432913,"there is a risk that modern practices of information communication and visualization in human-computer interaction can sideline communities due to their prioritization of scientific rationality. such ideological hegemony can complicate interactions with data and computers, especially for low-literate communities in the global south. through a six-month long ethnographic study with nakshi-katha makers, hindu idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information mediated decision making. we find that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting and communicating information often make use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers' cultural practices and the physical location. further, we identify how medium has significant influence in meaning-making. often these strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. in this paper, we discuss how this rural tradition differs from the modern information communication practices, discussing how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information can be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural bangladesh and similar communities.",1021
Tensions between Access and Control in Makerspaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432914,"makerspaces have complex access control requirements and are increasingly protected through digital access control mechanisms (e.g., keycards, transponders). however, it remains unclear how space administrators craft access control policies, how existing technical infrastructures support and fall short of access needs, and how these access control policies impact end-users in a makerspace. we bridge this gap through a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder study. specifically, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with makerspace administrators across the u.s. along with a survey of 48 makerspace end-users. we found four factors influenced administrators' construction of access control policies: balancing safety versus access; logistics; prior experience; and, the politics of funding. moreover, administrators often made situational exceptions to their policies: e.g., during demand spikes, to maintain a good relationship with their staff, and if they trusted the user(s) requesting an exception. conversely, users expressed frustration with the static nature of access control policies, wishing for negotiability and for social nuance to be factored into access decisions. the upshot is that existing mechanisms for access control in makerspaces are often inappropriately static and socially unaware.",1022

Explainable Active Learning (XAL): Toward AI Explanations as Interfaces for Machine Teachers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432934,"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations.",1042

A System for Interleaving Discussion and Summarization in Online Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432940,"in many instances of online collaboration, ideation and deliberation about what to write happen separately from the synthesis of the deliberation into a cohesive document. however, this may result in a final document that has little connection to the discussion that came before. in this work, we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all discussion points. we implement this process into a tool called wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. we conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with google docs. we found that wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. a second study demonstrated that in larger groups, wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools.",1048
"Piracy and the Impaired Cyborg: Assistive Technologies, Accessibility, and Access",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432941,"this paper examines software piracy in the global south from an accessibility lens, using the bio-technical metaphor of the 'cyborg.' drawing on qualitative interviews with people with visual impairment (vi) from india and peru, the paper interrogates the intimate relationships that users have with assistive technologies (ats). it outlines the effectiveness of ats in allowing users to actively control and shape their own lives and identities, and describes the various modalities that regulate the human body, technology, and human body-technology linkages. the paper argues that software piracy, when looked through the lens of the 'cyborg,' is an act of self-making that is motivated by a desire to gain autonomy and independence, i.e., it can be understood as a way to overcome the barriers that undermine access to the technological self. further, software piracy allows a shift in the distribution of power from those who control and regulate the assistive technologies to the cyborgs themselves.",1049
Pulling Back the Curtain on the Wizards of Oz,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432942,"the wizard of oz method is an increasingly common practice in hci and cscw studies as part of iterative design processes for interactive systems. instead of designing a fully-fledged system, the 'technical work' of key system components is completed by human operators yet presented to study participants as if computed by a machine. however, little is known about how wizard of oz studies are interactionally and collaboratively achieved in situ by researchers and participants. by adopting an ethnomethodological perspective, we analyse our use of the method in studies with a voice-controlled vacuum robot and two researchers present. we present data that reveals how such studies are organised and presented to participants and unpack the coordinated orchestration work that unfolds 'behind the scenes' to complete the study. we examine how the researchers attend to participant requests and technical breakdowns, and discuss the performative, collaborative, and methodological nature of their work. we conclude by offering insights from our application of the approach to others in the hci and cscw communities for using the method.",1050

Unequal Impacts of Augmented Reality on Learning and Collaboration During Robot Programming with Peers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432944,"augmented reality (ar) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. while the effects of ar experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of ar on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. however, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. in this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. we use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. we investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants? proximity to resources. we find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. detailed analysis shows that ar strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. we discuss the implications of these results for designing ar and non-ar collaborative interfaces.",1052

Understanding Women's Remote Collaborative Programming Experiences: The Relationship between Dialogue Features and Reported Perceptions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432952,"in recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. it is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. this paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants? normalized learning gain, intrinsic motivation inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. however, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. these findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive.",1060

Towards Building Community Collective Efficacy for Managing Digital Privacy and Security within Older Adult Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432954,"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.",1062

Towards Supporting Programming Education at Scale via Live Streaming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434168,"live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. to understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. for example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment.",1066
Looking for a Deal?: Visual Social Attention during Negotiations via Mixed Media Videoconferencing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434169,"whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., facetime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other ui elements. we analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). we used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). in contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. there were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. as mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks.",1067
