The Perpetual Work Life of Crowdworkers: How Tooling Practices Increase Fragmentation in Crowdwork,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359126,"Crowdworkers regularly support their work with scripts, extensions, and software to enhance their productivity. Despite their evident significance, little is understood regarding how these tools affect crowdworkers' quality of life and work. In this study, we report findings from an interview study (N=21) aimed at exploring the tooling practices used by full-time crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our interview data suggests that the tooling utilized by crowdworkers (1) strongly contributes to the fragmentation of microwork by enabling task switching and multitasking behavior; (2) promotes the fragmentation of crowdworkers' work-life boundaries by relying on tooling that encourages a 'work-anywhere' attitude; and (3) aids the fragmentation of social ties within worker communities through limited tooling access. Our findings have implications for building systems that unify crowdworkers' work practice in support of their productivity and well-being."
Vicariously Experiencing it all Without Going Outside: A Study of Outdoor Livestreaming in China,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359127,"The livestreaming industry in China is gaining greater traction than its European and North American counterparts and has a profound impact on the stakeholders' online and offline lives. An emerging genre of livestreaming that has become increasingly popular in China is outdoor livestreaming. With outdoor livestreams, streamers broadcast outdoor activities, travel, or socialize with passersby in outdoor settings, often for 6 or more hours, and viewers watch such streams for hours each day. However, given that professionally produced content about travel and outdoor activities are not very popular, it is currently unknown what makes this category of livestreams so engaging and how these techniques can be applied to other content or genres. Thus, we conducted a mixed methods study consisting of a survey (N=287) and interviews (N = 20) to understand how viewers watch and engage with outdoor livestreams in China. The data revealed that outdoor livestreams encompass many categories of content, environments and passersby behaviors create challenges and uncertainty for viewers and streamers, and viewers watch livestreams for surprising lengths of time (e.g., sometimes more than 5 continuous hours). We also gained insights into how live commenting and virtual gifting encourage engagement. Lastly, we detail how the behaviors of dedicated fans and casual viewers differ and provide implications for the design of livestreaming services that support outdoor activities."
Customizations and Expression Breakdowns in Ecosystems of Communication Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359128,"The growing adoption of emojis, stickers and GIFs suggests a corresponding demand for rich, personalized expression in messaging apps. Some people customize apps to enable more personal forms of expression, yet we know little about how such customizations shape everyday communication. Since people increasingly communicate via multiple apps side-by-side, we are also interested in how customizing one app influences communication via other apps. We created a taxonomy of customization options based on interviews with 15 ""extreme users"" of communication apps. We found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. They also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. We conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps."
Orienting to Networked Grief: Situated Perspectives of Communal Mourning on Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359129,"Contemporary American experiences of death and mourning increasingly extend onto social network sites, where friends gather to memorialize the deceased. That ""everyone grieves in their own way'' may be true, but it forecloses important questions about how people evaluate these expressions, their relationship to others who are grieving, and impacts on their own experiences of grief. Drawing from mixed-methods research conducted over five years, we describe how individuals position themselves within and evaluate expressions of networked grief. We start by identifying five orientations -- reinforcing, supporting, transferring, objecting, and isolating -- that describe how individuals evaluate actions of grievers, position themselves relative to the network, and act when they encounter grief. We then describe factors and tensions that influence how individuals arrive at these orientations. Based on our findings, we argue that the design of social media can be sensitized to diverse needs by adopting a situated perspective within a dynamic post-mortem network."
Crowdsourcing Perceptions of Fair Predictors for Machine Learning: A Recidivism Case Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359130,"The increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. Identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. In our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. We divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. Our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. We find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. The presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion."
Makers and Quilters: Investigating Opportunities for Improving Gender-Imbalanced Maker Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359131,"Recent efforts to diversify participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) activities through informal learning environments, such as hackathons and makerspaces, confirm a real desire for inclusion among potential female participants. However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space."
Automatically Analyzing Brainstorming Language Behavior with Meeter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359132,"Language both influences and indicates group behavior, and we need tools that let us study the content of what is communicated. While one could annotate these spoken dialogue acts by hand, this is a tedious, not scalable process. We present Meeter, a tool for automatically detecting information sharing, shared understanding, word counts, and group activation in spoken interactions. The contribution of our work is two-fold: (1) We validated the tool by showing that the measures computed by Meeter align with human-generated labels, and (2) we demonstrated the value of Meeter as a research tool by quantifying aspects of group behavior using those measures and deriving novel findings from that. Our tool is valuable for researchers conducting group science, as well as those designing groupware systems."
Towards Successful Knowledge Integration in Online Collaboration: An Experiment on the Role of Meta-Knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359133,"Successful knowledge integration, that is, systematic synthesis of unshared information, is key to suc-cess, but at the same time a challenging venture for teams with distributed knowledge collaborating online. For example, teams with heterogeneous knowledge often have only vague or even wrong ideas about who knows what. This situation is further complicated if the collaboration partners do not know each other and merely communicate online. Previous research has found meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge about one's own and the partner's knowledge areas, to be a promising but not yet sufficient-ly investigated approach to promote knowledge integration. With our experimental study we aimed to address this desideratum of research on the role of meta-knowledge in net-based collaborations. We ""simulated"" a chat-based collaboration between partners with heterogeneous knowledge by assigning specific information to students collaborating in dyads on a Hidden Profile task. To arrive at the correct joint solution for this task, collaborating partners had to pool their shared, but more importantly their unshared information. We compared two conditions: In the experimental condition meta-knowledge was promoted by providing the collaboration partners with self-presentations of each other's roles, which pointed to their unique fields of knowledge, while participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Results suggest a positive impact of the meta-knowledge manipulation on two key factors of collaboration: knowledge integration and construction of a transactive memory system (TMS)."
"""This Place Does What It Was Built For"": Designing Digital Institutions for Participatory Change",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359134,"Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the ""Ostrom Workshop."" A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a ""constitutional layer"" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions."
The Dynamics of Peer-Produced Political Information During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359135,"Wikipedia plays a crucial role for online information seeking and its editors have a remarkable capacity to rapidly revise its content in response to current events. How did the production and consumption of political information on Wikipedia mirror the dynamics of the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign? Drawing on systems justification theory and methods for measuring the enthusiasm gap among voters, this paper quantitatively analyzes the candidates' biographical and related articles and their editors. Information production and consumption patterns match major events over the course of the campaign, but Trump-related articles show consistently higher levels of engagement than Clinton-related articles. Analysis of the editors' participation and backgrounds show analogous shifts in the composition and durability of the collaborations around each candidate. The implications for using Wikipedia to monitor political engagement are discussed."
Implications of Grassroots Sustainable Agriculture Community Values on the Design of Information Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359136,"Information system designers embed values into the systems they design, even if unwittingly. However, the values embedded in many information systems clash with values held by many sustainability communities. This research focuses on two grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, which are seeking to develop a food infrastructure that is under their own control, and thereby more resilient to disruptions across the globe. This paper presents a five-year ethnographic study of these two communities, maps out the values of members of these communities, and explores the implications of their values on the information systems that members use and that could be developed to support them in the future. By doing so, we hope to influence the design of future information systems to align more closely with the values of these stakeholders, and through these stakeholders to move toward a food system that supports food security and global sustainability."
Towards Digitization of Collaborative Savings Among Low-Income Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274304,"Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) is a mechanism of informal collaborative savings that is widely used across the globe. Despite its popularity and prevalence, it is not well-studied from HCI and CSCW perspectives. The global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based Digital Financial Services (DFS) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any DFS-based interventions around ROSCAs. In this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and opportunities for their digitization in the Pakistani context. We also present a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. The platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. We present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups). We find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional ROSCAs by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. It also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility."
"""The Most Trustworthy Coin"": How Ideological Tensions Drive Trust in Bitcoin",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359138,"Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally ""trustless"" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts."
StressMon: Scalable Detection of Perceived Stress and Depression Using Passive Sensing of Changes in Work Routines and Group Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359139,"Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21% TPR, 66.71% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management."
How I Learned What a Domain Was,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359140,"This paper re-traverses the author's investigations across several years as he sought to pin-down the meaning of the in vivo category 'domain'. The paper is a methodological reflection on the grounded theory approach to concept development, with a focus on the technical terms: in vivo category, iteration on the code, and sensitizing category. It is also a substantive theoretical contribution, elaborating the concept of a domain in computing, data and information science, and how it has long served as an organizing principle for developing computational systems. Four tricks of the trade for studying the 'logic of domains' are offered as sensitizing concepts to aid future investigations."
How Data Scientists Use Computational Notebooks for Real-Time Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359141,"Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists."
Challenges and Design Considerations for Multimodal Asynchronous Collaboration in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359142,"Studies on collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) have suggested capture and later replay of multimodal interactions (e.g., speech, body language, and scene manipulations), which we refer to as multimodal recordings, as an effective medium for time-distributed collaborators to discuss and review 3D content in an immersive, expressive, and asynchronous way. However, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous VR collaboration (MAVRC) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. This study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing MAVRC as a type of CSCW and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of MAVRC systems. To this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (N = 15) used an experimental MAVRC system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. Qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of MAVRC in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3D scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. We discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for MAVRC systems."
"""I think people are powerful"": The Sociality of Individuals Managing Depression",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359143,"Millions of Americans struggle with depression, a condition characterized by feelings of sadness and motivation loss. To understand how individuals managing depression conceptualize their self-management activities, we conducted visual elicitations and semi-structured interviews with 30 participants managing depression in a large city in the U.S. Midwest. Many depression support tools are focused on the individual user and do not often incorporate social features. However, our analysis showed the key importance of sociality for self-management of depression. We describe how individuals connect with specific others to achieve expected support and how these interactions are mediated through locations and communication channels. We discuss factors influencing participants' sociality including relationship roles and expectations, mood state and communication channels, location and privacy, and culture and society. We broaden our understanding of sociality in CSCW through discussing diffuse sociality (being proximate to others but not interacting directly) as an important activity to support depression self-management."
Collaborative Data Work Towards a Caring Democracy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359144,"Researchers in human-centered computing have surfaced a feminist ethic of care in interaction with technologies, in data collection, and in data work. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. We discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. We conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small."
VidLyz: An Interactive Approach to Assist Novice Entrepreneurs in Making Persuasive Campaign Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359145,"Videos are essential for successful crowdfunding campaigns. However, without knowledge of the underlying persuasion factors, novice entrepreneurs may find it difficult to optimize their videos for success. This paper presents VidLyz, a novel assistive tool that allows users to explore the implications of audience-engagement persuasion factors in the context of campaign videos through contrasting examples, crowd-sourced subjective ratings, and feedback on engagement factors. VidLyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. To evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 Kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype VidLyz tool. A user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. The interactive and active thinking elements of VidLyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. A follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan. We concluded with design implications to better support novice entrepreneurs."
Technological Frames and User Innovation: Exploring Technological Change in Community Moderation Teams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359146,Management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. The successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. This paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (Reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (Discord). Moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of Discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on Reddit. We found that moderation teams used Discord's API to create scripts and bots that augmented Discord to make the platform work more like tools on Reddit. These tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. Our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations.
Causal Effects of Brevity on Style and Success in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359147,"In online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. In this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. What is the causal effect of brevity on message success? What are the linguistic traits of brevity? When is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? Whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. We find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. The optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. The observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. Finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. Overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media."
"""My cousin bought the phone for me. I never go to mobile shops."": The Role of Family in Women's Technological Inclusion in Islamic Culture",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359148,"The intersection of Islam and gender affect technological and social interactions for Muslim women in significant ways and remains an understudied domain for CSCW and related fields. Building on 73 qualitative interviews with low-income women in Punjab, Pakistan, we analyze the complexity of family relationships and the subsequent dynamics of authority around technology uptake and usage by women within non-Western contexts, and, specifically, within the Islamic world. We argue that a Pakistani woman's experience with technology depends on many factors, including gendered roles, generational differences in a family, and wider socio-cultural and religious influences against the backdrop of a culturally conservative and patriarchal society. Our paper highlights the rich family dynamics, including key life events, that transform the roles of both Muslim women and their relatives. Our work is intended to inform scholars, practitioners within development agencies and industry, and other individuals studying technology and development about household dynamics that influence Muslim women's use of technology to encourage them to consider these dynamics during design and implementation processes for technological inclusion."
Information Materialities of Citizen Communication in the U.S. Congress,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359149,"In this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the U.S. Congress. We work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in Washington D.C. and 48 interviews with staff in the House of Representatives. Customer relation management systems (CRMs) used by Congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. We find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. CRMs not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. Thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. This has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy."
Speedrunning for Charity: How Donations Gather Around a Live Streamed Couch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359150,"Games Done Quick (GDQ) is both a week-long video game speedrunning marathon and a successful charity event, raising more than $1.5 million USD in each of its past five events. To understand GDQ's success as an online charity event, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with GDQ speedrunners, attendees, hosts, and online viewers, analyzed past donation data, and conducted 72 hours of in-person participant observations at a live GDQ event. We found that central to every GDQ event is ""the couch"" which reconstructs the environment of a living room. Viewers do not simply donate to support the charity or in response to the technical prowess and ingenuity of speedrunners, but to actively interact with and be part of the couch experience, the ideal social milieu of speedrunning. Building upon previously identified motivations of why viewers donate to online live streamers, our work contributes to understanding how collocated gatherings can reinforce and amplify the cultural and social aspects of online subcultures (even heterogeneous ones) to encourage charitable giving. This opens opportunities for design that evoke a visceral level of engagement with charity events similar to that observed at GDQ."
Learn2Earn: Using Mobile Airtime Incentives to Bolster Public Awareness Campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359151,"In rural parts of the developing world, spreading awareness about critical issues in health, governance, and other topics is challenging and costly. Traditional media such as print, radio and TV each have limitations and offer little guarantee that new information is absorbed or retained by the target population. This paper describes Learn2Earn, a system that leverages mobile payments to bolster public awareness campaigns in rural India. Users call an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. People who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. We describe a pilot deployment of Learn2Earn in rural India that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. Usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. In a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that Learn2Earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics."
The Principles and Limits of Algorithm-in-the-Loop Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359152,"The rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. Yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. Society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. Given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. This paper contributes to such research in two ways. First, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. Second, through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. We studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. Although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. Under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. These results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact."
The Coerciveness of the Primary Key: Infrastructure Problems in Human Services Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359153,"The premise of a primary key is simple enough: every record or row in a table should have some number or string that can uniquely identify it. Primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. Yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. Through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. Yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. The technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. We conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts."
Computing Education for Intercultural Learning: Lessons from the Nairobi Play Project,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359154,"This paper explores computing education as a potential site for intercultural learning and encounter in post-conflict environments. It reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the Nairobi Play Project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in Kenya. While the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. Based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. We argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. We also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. We reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in CSCW, ICTD, and allied fields of work."
A Forensic Qualitative Analysis of Contributions to Wikipedia from Anonymity Seeking Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359155,"By choice or by necessity, some contributors to commons-based peer production sites use privacy-protecting services to remain anonymous. As anonymity seekers, users of the Tor network have been cast both as ill-intentioned vandals and as vulnerable populations concerned with their privacy. In this study, we use a dataset drawn from a corpus of Tor edits to Wikipedia to uncover the character of Tor users' contributions. We build in-depth narrative descriptions of Tor users' actions and conduct a thematic analysis that places their editing activity into seven broad groups. We find that although their use of a privacy-protecting service marks them as unusual within Wikipedia, the character of many Tor users' contributions is in line with the expectations and norms of Wikipedia. However, our themes point to several important places where lack of trust promotes disorder, and to contributions where risks to contributors, service providers, and communities are unaligned."
Restoration Work: Responding to Everyday Challenges of HIV Outreach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359156,"There has been a growing commitment across the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) towards investigating the design and deployment of technologies in the context of complex healthcare ecologies. We present a qualitative inquiry of one such context, as we examine the outreach practices and everyday challenges of workers at a community-based organization in Gujarat (India) that works with People Living with the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus(PLHIV). Drawing on Yosso's framework of community cultural wealth-apt for such intersectional settings-and the lens of articulation work, we describe how the workers at Vikas build and strengthen varied forms of capital to restore ""old normals,"" or what life was like for their PLHIV clients prior to diagnoses. Finally, we propose that attention to this nature of restoration work, and the workers' engagement with diverse forms of community cultural wealth, allows us to reflect on how technologies might (or might not) be designed to impact social and affective aspects of health."
Moderation Challenges in Voice-based Online Communities on Discord,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359157,"Online community moderators are on the front lines of combating problems like hate speech and harassment, but new modes of interaction can introduce unexpected challenges. In this paper, we consider moderation practices and challenges in the context of real-time, voice-based communication through 25 in-depth interviews with moderators on Discord. Our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. Not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. While moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations. Based on these findings, we discuss how voice communication complicates current understandings and assumptions about moderation, and outline ways that platform designers and administrators can design technology to facilitate moderation."
Dissonance Between Human and Machine Understanding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359158,"Complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. Models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. It is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. In this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. In particular, we seek to answer the following questions: Which (well performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? Our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans."
Infrastructuring Food Democracy: The Formation of a Local Food Hub in the Context of Socio-Economic Deprivation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359159,"This paper discusses what infrastructuring in participatory design can contribute to processes of food system democratisation. It presents almost two years of engagement with a community-based organisation in a socio-economically deprived neighbourhood in England with the aim of developing a local food hub. It documents how the collaborative work shifted from setting up an infrastructure to ongoing infrastructuring of an enabling environment to grow and sustain social innovation. While the former focused on a technological platform and a business to deliver inclusivity, customer experience, and marketing, the latter focuses on building lasting relationships on three levels: strengthening ties within the community-based organisation, offering social spaces to connect with the local community, and with other organisations by forming coalitions with mutual benefits. We contribute three design opportunities: First, in order to infrastructure the formation of publics around food initiatives, we need to design for relationship building. Second, we point to design implications for ethical aspirations, participation, and system transformation towards a food democracy. Finally, we reflect on the sustainability of infrastructuring and the role of designers to work towards independent infrastructures."
An Empirical Study of How Socio-Spatial Formations are Influenced by Interior Elements and Displays in an Office Context,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359160,"The design of a workplace can have a profound impact on the effectiveness of the workforce utilizing the space. When considering dynamic social activities in the flow of work, the constraints of the static elements of the interior reveals the adaptive behaviour of the occupants in trying to accommodate these constraints while performing their daily tasks. To better understand how workplace design shapes social interactions, we ran an empirical study in an office context over a two week period. We collected video from 24 cameras in a dozen space configurations totaling 1,920 hours of recorded activities. We utilized computer vision techniques, to produce skeletonized representations of the occupants, to assist in the annotation and data analysis process. We present our findings of socio-spatial formation patterns and the effects of furniture and interior elements on the observed behaviour of collaborators for both computer-supported work and for unmediated social interaction. Combining the observations with an interview of the occupants' reflections, we discuss dynamics of socio-spatial formations and how this knowledge can support social interactions in the domain of space design systems and interactive interiors."
Privacy Perceptions and Designs of Bystanders in Smart Homes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359161,"As the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. While prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. Our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. We conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. We identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). We highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. We discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes."
Circadian Rhythms and Physiological Synchrony: Evidence of the Impact of Diversity on Small Group Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359162,"Circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. Depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,""early birds"" and ""night owls""), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. Early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. Prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. We investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. We find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. Physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. Specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. Based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity."
Hateful People or Hateful Bots?: Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359163,"Arabic Twitter space is crawling with bots that fuel political feuds, spread misinformation, and proliferate sectarian rhetoric. While efforts have long existed to analyze and detect English bots, Arabic bot detection and characterization remains largely understudied. In this work, we contribute new insights into the role of bots in spreading religious hatred on Arabic Twitter and introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify Arabic language bots. Our assessment shows that existing tools that are highly accurate in detecting English bots don't perform as well on Arabic bots. We identify the possible reasons for this poor performance, perform a thorough analysis of linguistic, content, behavioral and network features, and report on the most informative features that distinguish Arabic bots from humans as well as the differences between Arabic and English bots. Our results mark an important step toward understanding the behavior of malicious bots on Arabic Twitter and pave the way for a more effective Arabic bot detection tools."
Efficient Elicitation Approaches to Estimate Collective Crowd Answers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359164,"When crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. Unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. Despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. We investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. Annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. Estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. Our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. Instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. This resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). By analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. Our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ML training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions."
"""When you can do it, why can't I?"": Racial and Socioeconomic Differences in Family Technology Use and Non-Use",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359165,"There is racial diversity as well as economic inequality in the United States (U.S.). To gain a nuanced understanding of how households from different socio economic and racial backgrounds integrate technology into their lives, we conducted a diary study with 22 parents who were Asian Indian (the fastest-growing immigrant population in U.S.) and 18 who were White American (the largest racial group in U.S.) parents from the working and middle classes. The participants logged in-situ instances of using smart phones and speaker use by, with, and around children for 8 weeks, and were interviewed once every four weeks (two times in total). Our findings reveal differences and similarities in parents' attitudes and practices of using or not using these devices around and with children, in parental restrictions of children's use of technology, and children's daily use patterns. The paper concludes with a discussions of the implications of our findings and suggestions for future design improvements in smart phones and speakers."
Live Streaming as Co-Performance: Dynamics between Center and Periphery in Theatrical Engagement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359166,"Live streaming is a highly participatory form of performance, involving various types of audience participation such as liking, commenting, and gifting. But how do streamers and audiences collaborate to deliver live streaming performances? We approach this question through an interview study with 30 spectators and eight streamers in China. Drawing from theatrical engagement research, we use the cogitative spatial concept of center-peripheral attention of the audience to analyze the complex interplay between streamers and spectators, where the former occupy the center and the latter the periphery. We then discuss the orchestration of the center and the periphery, where streamers and spectators coordinate their respective performances, as well as the interaction between the center and the periphery, where the center-periphery distinction blurs. Based on these findings, we discuss co-performance as a theatrical metaphor for understanding live streaming and audience engagement."
"""I Think You'll Like It"": Modelling the Online Purchase Behavior in Social E-commerce",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359167,"Understanding the roles of social factors in online purchase behavior has been a long standing research problem. The recently emerging social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth effect to promote the sales of items, which offers a peek into the complex interplay between the social influence and online purchasing behavior. In this paper, we investigate this problem on a full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social e-commerce platforms, Beidian. Specifically, we conduct a comparison study between the social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce that are both integrated in Beidian to examine how social factors affect user's purchase behavior. We reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09~10.37 times higher purchase conversion rate compared with the conventional settings, which indicates users make purchase with significantly fewer item explorations. Then, we propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. Moreover, we identify several behavioral indicators that are able to measure the effect of these mechanisms, based on which we design an accurate predictive model (AUC=0.7738) for user's purchase decision. These results combine to shed light on how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social e-commerce."
Higher Education Check-Ins: Exploring the User Experience of Hybrid Location Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359168,"A large body of literature is dedicated to understanding people's check-in behavior when they use location sharing services to pair their location with a venue, e.g., a restaurant, a park, etc. Check-in behavior in higher education settings, e.g., where students and instructors have academic purposes for check-ins, is under-studied. In this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes."
Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359169,"Online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. While past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. Using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. We characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. Through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three Asian countries with their counterparts from primarily Western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. Contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. While these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. We find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums."
"Culturally-Embedded Visual Literacy: A Study of Impression Management via Emoticon, Emoji, Sticker, and Meme on Social Media in China",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359170,"Social media is often analyzed as a ""front stage"" where social media users perform their identities and manage impressions through various forms of user-generated content: text, picture, video, as well as visual expression such as emoticon, emoji, sticker, and meme. Previous scholarship has suggested various functions of visual expression in supporting computer-mediated communication. In this study, we move beyond the utility perspective to ask what constitutes the literacy to utilize visual expression for impression management. Towards this goal, we conducted an interview study with 30 social media users in China. We found that visual literacy intersects with its cultural context. Our interviewees used text and visual expressions in sophisticated, skillful ways and tailored for different audiences in order to construct desired images. They also interacted with audience memory in order to perform their uniqueness and creativity. Lastly, we discuss culturally-embedded visual literacy and provide implications for design."
How Emotional and Contextual Annotations Involve in Sensemaking Processes of Foreign Language Social Media Posts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359171,"The goal of this paper is to investigate how computational tools to annotate communication can support multilingual sense-making on social media. We conducted a field study of SenseTrans, a browser extension that uses sentiment analysis and named entity extraction techniques to annotate Facebook posts with emotional and contextual information. Interviews with 18 participants who used SenseTrans in their Facebook newsfeed for two weeks suggest that the annotations often supported sensemaking by providing additional information they could use to get a quick gist of the posts or to supplement their own interpretations. Participants varied in the extent to which they were motivated to evaluate the credibility of and form mental models of how the annotations were generated, which shaped how they utilized the annotations for sensemaking. Our findings demonstrate the value of designing to support cross-lingual communication and inform design implications for intelligent tools that support communication and sensemaking."
"""Am I Never Going to Be Free of All This Crap?"": Upsetting Encounters with Algorithmically Curated Content About Ex-Partners",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172,"Every day on social media, people see streams of content curated by algorithms that leverage their relationships, preferences, and identities. However, algorithms can oversimplify the complexity of people's social contexts. Consequently, algorithms can present content to people in ways that are insensitive to their circumstances. Through 19 in-depth interviews, our empirical study examines instances of contextually insensitive content through the lens of people's upsetting encounters with content about their ex-romantic partners on Facebook. We characterize the encounters our participants had with content about their exes, including where on Facebook it occurred, the types of social connections involved in the content, and participants' perceptions of why the content appeared. Based on our findings, we describe the ""social periphery""---the complex social networks and data that enable inferred connections around otherwise explicit relationships---and discuss the design challenges that the periphery presents designers."
Including the Voice of Care Recipients in Community Health Feedback Loops in Rural Kenya,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359173,"Community health programs in low-resource settings (like rural Kenya) aim to provide essential health services to vulnerable populations. However, to date, there has been limited research that explores the design of mechanisms that enable care recipients to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the services they receive. Such feedback has the potential to increase the motivation of community health workers (CHWs), enhance training procedures, detect fraudulent behavior, and inform key performance indicators for health programs. Our paper explores the design and deployment of a USSD-based system that allows anyone who possesses a basic mobile phone to provide feedback regarding the health services and quality of care they received from a CHW or during a hospital visit. Our system was designed through iterative fieldwork in rural Kenya that engaged with multiple stakeholder groups, including care recipients, CHWs, and high-level decision makers. After designing and testing the system, we deployed it for seven weeks in Siaya, Kenya, collecting both quantitative system usage data and qualitative data from six focus groups with 42 participants. Findings from our deployment show that 168 care recipients engaged with the system, submitting 495 reports via USSD. We discuss the broader factors impacting deployment, including the feasibility of USSD, actionability of feedback, scalability, and sustainability. Taken together, our findings suggest that USSD is a promising approach for enabling care recipients to submit feedback in a way that balances privacy, equity, and sustainability."
Reliability and Inter-rater Reliability in Qualitative Research: Norms and Guidelines for CSCW and HCI Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359174,"What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: ""should I calculate IRR?"" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research."
'Routine Infrastructuring' as 'Building Everyday Resilience with Technology': When Disruption Becomes Ordinary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359175,"Getting a divorce. Being diagnosed with a disease. Going through a relationship breakup. Living through a natural disaster. All of these events are often life disrupting and debilitating. While some disruptive events are short-lived, some can be a routine part of everyday life. This leads to the question of how people who experience prolonged disruption in their lives build resilience---that is, how do they manage and overcome such events? To explore this question, this paper utilizes a case study approach to explore the use, creation, and re-appropriation of technology across three prolonged disruptions-the Second Gulf War in Iraq, veteran transitions, and the coming out experiences of LGBTQ-identifying people. Using a conceptual frame that brings together routine dynamics and infrastructuring, we find that engaging in routine infrastructuring practices generated resilience in people's daily lives---a phenomenon we dub 'routine infrastructuring' as 'building everyday resilience with technology.' We then theorize properties of infrastructure and infrastructuring practice that enable resiliency, and conclude with how infrastructuring is a form of care work that is oriented towards individuals, communities, and society."
Collaboration Drives Individual Productivity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359176,"How does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? Results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. The difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. We address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: GitHub and Wikipedia. By analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. This effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. People tend to do more when collaborating with more people. We propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. The proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in GitHub and Wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration."
Should We Use an Abstract Comic Form to Persuade?: Experiments with Online Charitable Donation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359177,"This paper examines the use of the abstract comic form for persuading online charitable donations. Persuading individuals to contribute to charitable causes online is hard and responses to the appeals are typically low; charitable donations share the structure of public goods dilemmas where the rewards are distant and non-exclusive. In this paper, we examine if comics in abstract form are more persuasive than in the plain text form. Drawing on a rich literature on comics, we synthesized a three-panel abstract comic to create our appeal. We conducted a between-subject study with 307 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the use of abstract comic form to appeal for charitable donations. As part of our experimental procedure, we sought to persuade individuals to contribute to a real charity focused on Autism research with monetary costs. We compared the average amount of donation to the charity under three conditions: the plain text message, an abstract comic that includes the plain text, and an abstract comic that additionally includes the social proof. We use Bayesian modeling to analyze the results, motivated by model transparency and its use in small-sized studies. Our experiments reveal that the message in abstract comic form elicited significantly more donations than text form (medium to large effect size=0.59). Incorporating social proof in the abstract comic message did not show a significant effect. Our studies have design implications: non-profits and governmental agencies interested in alleviating public goods dilemmas that share a similar structure to our experiment (single-shot task, distant, non-exclusive reward) ought to consider including messages in the abstract comic form as part of their online fund-raising campaign."
Understanding Expert Disagreement in Medical Data Analysis through Structured Adjudication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359178,"Expert disagreement is pervasive in clinical decision making and collective adjudication is a useful approach for resolving divergent assessments. Prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. In this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. Results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. We provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. Our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis."
"""Giving a little 'ayyy, I feel ya' to someone's personal post"": Performing Support on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359179,"Social media platforms offer people a variety of ways to interact, ranging from public broadcast posts, to comments on posts, to private messages, to paralinguistic interactions such as ""liking"" posts. In 2015, the commenting function ""replies"" was temporarily removed from Tumblr, providing a unique opportunity to study the deprivation of a standard social media feature. We administered a survey to investigate Tumblr users' perceptions and use of replies. Respondents reported that they used replies to simultaneously support others' performance and their own. Respondents compared replies to other digital interaction channels such as paralinguistic interactions, the sharing feature ""reblogs"", and ""direct messages"" (DMs), citing social considerations and norms around each. We used Goffman's performance theory to draw insights on the perceived semi-public / semi-private space of replies, which enabled users to perform supportive actions that did not belong in their main blogging identity frontstage but that were not backstage either. We discuss the limitation of performance theory to describe a presentation to a limited but unknown audience, and we describe how replies enabled new frontstages such as the delicate ramp up to the performance of intimacy in DMs. We discuss implications for performing support and identity on social media with audiences that are perceived as limited but are unknown."
Intentional Technology Use in Early Childhood Education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359180,"Early childhood is a critical developmental period when children's experiences have lasting impacts on long-term outcomes. Thus, an evidence-based understanding of how technology can support early childhood education (ECE) classrooms promises to be disproportionately useful to children's long-term wellbeing. We conducted an observational study at ten child-care centers, complemented by interviews with teachers and directors. Using a Uses and Gratifications (U&G) perspective, we found that the gratifications teachers seek when they incorporate technology into the classroom cluster into six categories, such as encouraging technology literacy, regulating children's behavior, and supporting child autonomy. Using these themes, we contribute a set of design priorities for supporting this population. We also contribute an expansion of the U&G perspective to include: 1) gratifications resisted, to account for the ways in which teachers resist gratifying uses of technology, and 2) differentiation between direct gratifications and indirect gratifications to better describe technology use in collaborative contexts."
Love in Lyrics: An Exploration of Supporting Textual Manifestation of Affection in Social Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359181,"Affectionate communication, the conveyance of closeness, care, and fondness for another, plays a key role in romantic relationships. While the pervasive use of digital technology for communication limits affectionate interaction through nonverbal cues -- a major channel of expression in face-to-face settings, there have been few approaches which scaffold couples' romantic text conversations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel interactive system Lily which gives users inspirations to enrich their romantic expressions in text messaging. It first listens to users' original input and then recommends romantic lyrics holding the closest meaning in real-time during chats with partners. After a three-day empirical study, participants who are real-life couples reported that they not only received useful cues from Lily in terms of how to polish their affectionate expressions, but also learnt to enrich the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. Based on our findings, we finally provide several design considerations for actual deployment of such an application."
All Users are (Not) Created Equal: Predictors Vary for Different Forms of Facebook Non/use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359182,"Relatively little work has empirically examined use and non-use of social technologies as more than a dichotomous binary, despite increasing calls to do so. This paper compares three different forms of non/use that might otherwise fall under the single umbrella of Facebook ""user"": (1) those who have a current active account; (2) those who have deactivated their account; and (3) those who have considered deactivating but not actually done so. A subset of respondents (N=256) from a larger, demographically representative sample of internet users completed measures for usage and perceptions of Facebook, Facebook addiction, privacy experiences and behaviors, and demographics. Multinomial logistic regression modeling shows four specific variables as most predictive of a respondent's type: negative effects from ""addictive"" use, subjective intensity of Facebook usage, number of Facebook friends, and familiarity with or use of Facebook's privacy settings. These findings both fill gaps left by, and help resolve conflicting expectations from, prior work. Furthermore, they demonstrate how valuable insights can be gained by disaggregating ""users"" based on different forms of engagement with a given technology."
Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359183,"Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. We present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. Using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Analyzing ~53K product pages from ~11K shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. We examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. We also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. Finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns."
"""I feel like only half a man"": Online Forums as a Resource for Finding a ""New Normal"" for Men Experiencing Fertility Issues",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359184,"Infertility can place a significant burden on couples and individuals when trying to conceive. Approximately 20-30% of all cases of infertility are due to male-related factors. Whatever the cause of difficulty in conceiving, little is known about how men find support when dealing with fertility issues, or when or how online resources are being used. This paper reports on a qualitative study of anonymous online posts (N=603) from forums related to fertility that are used by men. We analysed this data using thematic analysis to understand how men are using online forums as a resource when experiencing fertility issues. We found that online forums play a valued role in facilitating connections between men experiencing an often stigmatised condition. These forums offer men accessible and private spaces which allow for more open discussion, helping them to make sense of their situation. We discuss our findings in relation to Genuis and Bronstein's model of finding a ""new normal"" and present our elaborated model of finding a ""new normal"" in the context of experiencing fertility problems."
