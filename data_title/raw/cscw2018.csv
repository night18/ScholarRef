Editors' Message,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274285,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to this issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction, the second to focus on the contributions from the research community Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW). This journal model allows for rapid publication of papers shortly after acceptance as well as enabling automatic indexing services, such as Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) indexing. The aim is to increase the visibility of the work of authors in this community, and allow for better comparability with fields outside of Computer Science. This issue contains papers accepted over two iterations of the review process. The call for papers for this second issue, with an initial deadline in Spring 2018, attracted 722 submissions, from all around the world. After the first round of reviewing, 326 (45,2%) papers were invited to the Revise and Resubmit phase. The program committee worked hard over August 2018 to arrive at final decisions, with an online editorial committee meeting held to allow for collective deliberation. In the end, 184 papers (25,5%) were accepted. For some of those papers, authors received further shepherding and guidance by a senior committee member. This shows the commitment of the CSCW community to not only ensure high quality contributions, but also to educate and enable authors to write and present their best work for this community. This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 132 senior editorial committee members who served as Associate Chairs (ACs), and 837 external expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in both rounds."
Quotidian Report: Grassroots Data Practices to Address Public Safety,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274286,"We examine the local data practices of citizens in Mexico who use Facebook sites as a platform to report crimes and share safety-related information. We conducted 14 interviews with a variety of participants who collaborate as administrators and contributors of these online communities. The communities we examined have two central components: the citizens who crowd-source data about instances of crime in different neighborhoods in and around Mexico City, and the administrators of the Facebook sites who use the crowd-sourced data to intervene and collaborate with other stakeholders. From our interviews, we identify the community, data, and action practices used by group administrators to collect, curate, and publish information about public safety that would otherwise go unreported. The combination of these practices improves the reputation of the groups on Facebook, increases trust, and encourages sustained participation from citizens. These practices also legitimize data gathered by group members as an important grassroots tool for responding to issues of public safety that would otherwise not be reported or acted upon. Our findings contribute a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions."
"Hackers, Computers, and Cooperation: A Critical History of Logo and Constructionist Learning",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274287,"This paper examines the history of the learning theory ""constructionism"" and its most well-known implementation, Logo, to examine beliefs involving both ""C's"" in CSCW: computers and cooperation. Tracing the tumultuous history of one of the first examples of computer-supported cooperative learning (CSCL) allows us to question some present-day assumptions regarding the universal appeal of learning to program computers that undergirds popular CSCL initiatives today, including the Scratch programming environment and the ""FabLab"" makerspace movement. Furthermore, teasing out the individualistic and anti-authority threads in this project and its links to present day narratives of technology development exposes the deeply atomized and even oppositional notions of collaboration in these projects and others under the auspices of CSCW today that draw on early notions of 'hacker culture.' These notions tend to favor a limited view of work, learning, and practice-an invisible constraint that continues to inform how we build and evaluate CSCW technologies."
"Testing Waters, Sending Clues: Indirect Disclosures of Socially Stigmatized Experiences on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274288,"Indirect disclosure strategies include hinting about an experience or a facet of one's identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. These strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. Drawing on interviews with women in the U.S. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. Our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content explicitness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. We identify how people intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss. We discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss."
Acting the Part: Examining Information Operations Within #BlackLivesMatter Discourse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274289,"This research examines how Russian disinformation actors participated in a highly charged online conversation about the #BlackLivesMatter movement and police-related shootings in the USA during 2016. We first present high-level dynamics of this conversation on Twitter using a network graph based on retweet flows that reveals two structurally distinct communities. Next, we identify accounts in this graph that were suspended by Twitter for being affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, an entity accused of conducting information operations in support of Russian political interests. Finally, we conduct an interpretive analysis that consolidates observations about the activities of these accounts. Our findings have implications for platforms seeking to develop mechanisms for determining authenticity---by illuminating how disinformation actors enact authentic personas and caricatures to target different audiences. This work also sheds light on how these actors systematically manipulate politically active online communities by amplifying diverging streams of divisive content."
"With Few Eyes, All Hoaxes are Deep",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274290,"Quality control is critical to open production communities like Wikipedia. Wikipedia editors enact border quality control with edits (counter-vandalism) and new article creations (new page patrolling) shortly after they are saved. In this paper, we describe a long-standing set of inefficiencies that have plagued new page patrolling by drawing a contrast to the more efficient, distributed processes for counter-vandalism. Further, to address this issue, we demonstrate an effective automated topic model based on a labeling strategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in Wikipedia (WikiProject tags) and a flexible ontology (WikiProjects Directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set. We are able to attain very high fitness measures (macro ROC-AUC: 95.2%, macro PR-AUC: 74.5%) and real-time performance using word2vec-based features. Finally, we present a proposal for how incorporating this model into current tools will shift the dynamics of new article review positively."
Framing Effects: Choice of Slogans Used to Advertise Online Experiments Can Boost Recruitment and Lead to Sample Biases,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274291,"Online experimentation with volunteers relies on participants' non-financial motivations to complete a study, such as to altruistically support science or to compare oneself to others. Researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. Often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ""What is your thinking style?''). Research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. Could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? To investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. We found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a 'supporting science' frame to a 'comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. Additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. We discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers."
Departing and Returning: Sense of Agency as an Organizing Concept for Understanding Social Media Non/use Transitions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274292,"Recent work has identified a variety of motivations for various forms of technology use and non-use. However, less work has closely examined relationships between those motivations and the experiences of transiting among these different forms of use and non-use. This paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their Facebook account. An abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. The analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to Facebook or not. The discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use. Doing so shows how sense of agency may provide an organizing orientation for understanding subjective experiences of use and non-use."
Efficient Crowd Exploration of Large Networks: The Case of Causal Attribution,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274293,"Accurately and efficiently crowdsourcing complex, open-ended tasks can be difficult, as crowd participants tend to favor short, repetitive ""microtasks"". We study the crowdsourcing of large networks where the crowd provides the network topology via microtasks. Crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. We conduct experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. The core of the method, Iterative Pathway Refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. We evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on AMT to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. Worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference."
#pray4victims: Consistencies in Response to Disaster on Twitter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274294,"This paper studies commonalities in response across disasters in online social networks (OSNs), specifically Twitter. After presenting an algorithm for extracting vocabularies across disasters, we extract type-specific vocabularies for terrorist attacks, earthquakes, and climate-related disasters between 2012 and 2017. Disaster type drives vocabulary similarity: terrorism responses mention an ""attack"" and law enforcement, earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude, and climate-related responses include safety and requests for aid. Across disaster types, tweets regularly mention victims/affected and prayer, consistent with communal coping and social support in crisis aftermath. Using disaster-type vocabularies, we study Twitter as a proxy for severity, correlating casualties to frequencies in Twitter. These vocabularies better correlate with casualties than baseline crisis lexica, especially in western countries. Twitter response and casualties diverge at the maximum, and Twitter response is stronger in Western countries, suggesting perceived severity is driven by additional factors."
Supporting Collaboratively Constructed Independence: A Study of Spinal Cord Injury,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274295,"Independence is a central concern for people in the care of many chronic conditions. It is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. It is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. However, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. In this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) self-care. We found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. This collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. We describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability."
Investigating Crowd Creativity in Online Music Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274296,"Crowd creativity is typically associated with peer-production communities focusing on artistic products like animations, video games, and music, but less frequently to Open Source Software (OSS), despite the fact that also developers must be creative to come up with new solutions to their technical challenges. In this paper, we conduct a study to further the understanding of which factors from prior work in both OSS and art communities are predictive of successful collaboration - defined as reuse of previous songs - in three different songwriting communities, namely Songtree, Splice, and ccMixter. The main findings from this study confirm that the success of collaborations is associated with high community status of recognizable authors and low degree of derivativity of songs."
MechanicalHeart: A Human-Machine Framework for the Classification of Phonocardiograms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274297,"Listening to heart sounds is an important first step in evaluating the cardiovascular system and is important in the early detection of cardiovascular disease. We present and evaluate a framework for combining machine learning algorithms, crowd workers, and experts in the classification of heart sound recordings. The development of a hybrid human-machine framework is motivated by the past success in utilizing human computation to solve problems in medicine and the use of human-machine frameworks in other domains. We describe the methods that decide when and how to escalate the analysis of heart sounds to different resources and incorporate their decision into a final classification. Our framework was tested with a combination of machine classifiers and crowd workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results indicate a hybrid approach achieves greater performance than a baseline classifier alone, utilizing less expert resources while achieving similar performance, compared to a framework without the crowd."
UMI3D: A Unity3D Toolbox to Support CSCW Systems Properties in Generic 3D User Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274298,"UMI3D is a recent model which allows the generic description of 3D environments through a network. These generic environments can run outside of any device, on a server or on a separate computer. A unique dedicated application that we have named UMI3D client allows a VR, AR or MR device to interact with all the existing UMI3D environments. Moreover, the client-server architecture allows these environments to be collaborative. In this paper, we introduce a toolbox which allows the creation and running of UMI3D collaborative environments using Unity 3D. It contains tools to address the main concerns of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems in UMI3D environments. After introducing the contribution of this toolbox to the design of 3D CSCW systems, we present a user evaluation of an environment designed with this toolbox. Finally, we discuss the limits of the UMI3D model and the improvements that could be made to this model."
Complex and Ambiguous: Understanding Sticker Misinterpretations in Instant Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274299,"Stickers, though similar in appearance to emoji, have distinct characteristics because they often contain animation, diverse gestures, and multiple characters and objects. Stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. In this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. Toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in South Korea. We found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. In particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. In real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. Based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction."
SOLVENT: A Mixed Initiative System for Finding Analogies between Research Papers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274300,"Scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. To provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce SOLVENT, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. We demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities."
"The Internet's Hidden Rules: An Empirical Study of Reddit Norm Violations at Micro, Meso, and Macro Scales",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274301,"Norms are central to how online communities are governed. Yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. In this paper, we study community norms on Reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. Via 2.8M comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of Reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. Given the size of Reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. In other words, these findings shed light on what Reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities."
Data-Driven Proactive Policy Assurance of Post Quality in Community q&a Sites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274302,"To ensure the post quality, Q&A sites usually develop a list of quality assurance guidelines for ""dos and don'ts"", and adopt collaborative editing mechanism to fix quality violations. Quality guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected quality cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. Collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. Our study of collaborative editing data on Stack Overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive quality-assurance knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. Inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network based approach to learn editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. Our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential quality issues in a post before it is posted."
Beyond Lingua Franca: System-Facilitated Language Switching Diversifies Participation in Multiparty Multilingual Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274303,"When multiple non-native speakers (NNSs) who share the same native language join a group discussion with native speakers (NSs) of the common language used in the discussion, they sometimes switch back and forth between common language and their native language to reach common ground. However, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. To offer NNSs more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects a user's spoken language, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or NNS's native language). In a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two Japanese and two Chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. Results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more participation from NNSs - they increased active initiating behaviors from NNSs. Although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the NNS pairs."
'Staged for Living': Negotiating Objects and their Values over a Porous Boundary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274305,"We describe more than 19 months of ethnographic fieldwork with people who have embraced minimalism, a lifestyle movement focused on reducing modern life's clutter. We found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""Porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. A porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home."
Crowd Coach: Peer Coaching for Crowd Workers' Skill Growth,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274306,"Traditional employment usually provides mechanisms for workers to improve their skills to access better opportunities. However, crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) generally do not support skill development (i.e., becoming faster and better at work). While researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. However, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. To further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present Crowd Coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. We conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study Crowd Coach in the wild. Hundreds of workers used Crowd Coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. We find that Crowd Coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. We posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. We finish with design implications from our research."
Will Too Many Editors Spoil The Tag?: Conflicts and Alignment in Q&A Categorization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274307,"Q&A websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and responses. Many Q&As use collaborative tagging systems to improve search and discovery while distributing the work of categorizing and organization throughout the community. Although early work on collaborative tagging questioned whether consistent categorization schemes could emerge from large groups with little to no coordination, empirical studies have found surprising coherence among users' tags. We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). We found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict. This study highlights the importance of learning and moderation in the development of coherence in collaborative tagging systems."
Living in the Present: Understanding Long-Term Content Referencing in Enterprise Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274308,"Successful online communities accumulate large amounts of long-term content. However there has been little quantitative, theoretically-motivated exploration of how communities organize such content, nor which community members take responsibility for active organization. We examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. We first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. We next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. We show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. Further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. Our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. We explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content."
Engaging with Health Data: The Interplay Between Self-Tracking Activities and Emotions in Fertility Struggles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274309,"Self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. Lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. We explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. We qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. We found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. We discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. We also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. Finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area."
Spacetime Characterization of Real-Time Collaborative Editing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274310,"Real-Time Collaborative Editing (RTCE) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the Web. Little is known in the literature yet about RTCE usage patterns in the real world. In this paper we study how a popular RTCE editor (Etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. The pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as ""collaborative"" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. The model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. Classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. Findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. These findings help in revisiting early RTCE design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in RTCE protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing)."
Evaluating Crowdworkers as a Proxy for Online Learners in Video-Based Learning Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274311,"Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. Accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. We here report results from a crowdsourcing study (N=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and MOOC learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in MOOCs. This serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. Overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to MOOC learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. We conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities."
Coloring in the Links: Capturing Social Ties as They are Perceived,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274312,"The richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. Typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications."
'Too Gay for Facebook': Presenting LGBTQ+ Identity Throughout the Personal Social Media Ecosystem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274313,"Most US social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time."
Score-Group Framing Negatively Impacts Peer Evaluations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274314,"How does group membership framing affect the feedback students provide learners? This paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of Ingroup/Outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. Two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. In the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an Ingroup and Outgroup peer assignment. A second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two Ingroup assignments. In both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. These studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks."
Understanding Gender Equity in Author Order Assignment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274315,"Women remain underrepresented in many fields in computer science, particularly at higher levels. In academia, success and promotion are influenced by a researcher's publication record. In many fields, including computer science, multi-author papers are the norm. Evidence from other fields shows that author order norms can influence the assignment of credit. We conduct interviews of students and faculty in human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) to determine factors related to assignment of author order in collaborative publication. The outcomes of these interviews then informed metrics of interest for a bibliometric analysis of gender and collaboration in research papers published from 1996 to 2016 in three top HCI and ML conferences. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for assignment of credit in multi-author papers and interpretation of author order, particularly in regard to how this area affects women."
Shifting Expectations: Understanding Youth Employees' Handoffs in a 3D Print Shop,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274316,"As digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3D printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. Given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in ""making"" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. The combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. However, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. We investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3D print shop during one year of field work. In this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. We then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3D prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments."
The Influence of Friends and Experts on Privacy Decision Making in IoT Scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274317,"As increasingly many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. Personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. To better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine IoT data-collection scenarios. Some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. At the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. Our results help explain under what circumstances users are more or less likely to be swayed by the reported behavior of others in similar scenarios. For example, our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. On the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection. We also observed that influence could get stronger or wear off when participants were exposed to a sequence of scenarios. For example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed data collection in scenarios with clear risk or denied it in scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios."
Do Students' Learning Behaviors Differ when they Collaborate in Open-Ended Learning Environments?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274318,"Researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students' collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. In this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the Betty's Brain system. We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually."
Watch Me Code: Programming Mentorship Communities on Twitch.tv,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274319,"Live streaming-an emerging practice of broadcasting video of oneself in real time to an online audience-is often used by people to portray themselves engaged in a craft such as programming. Viewers of these 'creative streams' gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. However, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. We found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. We show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. Finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice."
Beyond the Coded Gaze: Analyzing Expression of Mental Health and Illness on Instagram,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274320,"In CSCW and HCI, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. This approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. The coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. In this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. We join manual collection of Instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how Instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. We argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. We discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online."
'Welcome' Changes?: Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in a Wikipedia Sub-Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274321,"Open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. Research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. In this study, we use the Focus Theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a Wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. We contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration."
Women (Still) Ask For Less: Gender Differences in Hourly Rate in an Online Labor Marketplace,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274322,"In many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. However, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). In this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the United States (48.8% women) on Upwork, a popular gig work platform. The median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. However, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. To better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities."
"Gender, Feedback, and Learners' Decisions to Share Their Creative Computing Projects",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274323,"Although informal online learning communities are made possible by users' decisions to share their creations, participation by females and other marginalized groups remains stubbornly low in technical communities. Using descriptive statistics and a unique dataset of shared and unshared projects from over 1.1 million users of Scratch-a collaborative programming community for young people-we show that while girls share less initially, this trend flips among experienced users. Using Bayesian regression analyses, we show that this relationship can largely be attributed to differences in the way boys and girls participate. We also find that while prior positive feedback is correlated with increased sharing among inexperienced users, this effect also reverses with experience or with the addition of controls. Our findings provide a description of the dynamics behind online learners' decisions to share, open new research questions, and point to several lessons for system designers."
To Label or Not to Label: The Effect of Stance and Credibility Labels on Readers' Selection and Perception of News Articles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274324,"Social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. For example, Blue Feed, Red Feed, a news feed created by the Wall Street Journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. To combat the spread of fake news, Facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. Although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption."
Social Photo-Elicitation: The Use of Communal Production of Meaning to Hear a Vulnerable Population,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274325,"We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ""new normal"". Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration."
Eight Observations and 24 Research Questions About Open Source Projects: Illuminating New Realities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274326,"The rapid acceleration of corporate engagement with open source projects is drawing out new ways for CSCW researchers to consider the dynamics of these projects. Research must now consider the complex ecosystems within which open source projects are situated, including issues of for-profit motivations, brokering foundations, and corporate collaboration. Localized project considerations cannot reveal broader workings of an open source ecosystem, yet much empirical work is constrained to a local context. In response, we present eight observations from our eight-year engaged field study about the changing nature of open source projects. We ground these observations through 24 research questions that serve as primers to spark research ideas in this new reality of open source projects. This paper contributes to CSCW in social and crowd computing by delivering a rich and fresh look at corporately-engaged open source projects with a call for renewed focus and research into newly emergent areas of interest."
Fake Cures: User-centric Modeling of Health Misinformation in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274327,"Social media's unfettered access has made it an important venue for health discussion and a resource for patients and their loved ones. However, the quality of information available, as well as the motivations of its posters, has been questioned. This work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). Using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 Twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such ""treatments"", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. Considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention."
GuessTheKarma: A Game to Assess Social Rating Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274328,"Popularity systems, like Twitter retweets, Reddit upvotes, and Pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. That, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. We conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores."
Personalized Motivation-supportive Messages for Increasing Participation in Crowd-civic Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274329,"In crowd-civic systems, citizens form groups and work towards shared goals, such as discovering social issues or reforming official policies. Unfortunately, many real-world systems have been unsuccessful in continually motivating large numbers of citizens to participate voluntarily, despite various approaches such as gamification and persuasion techniques. In this paper, we examine the influence of personalized messages designed to support motivation as asserted by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We designed a crowd-civic platform for collecting community issues with personalized motivation-supportive messages and conducted two studies: a pair-comparison experiment with 150 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and a live deployment study with 120 university members. Results of the pair-comparison study indicate applicability of SDT's perspective in crowd-civic systems. While applying it in the live system surfaced several challenges, including recruiting participants without interfering with general motivations, the collected data exhibited similar promising trends."
"Navigating the Healthcare Service ""Black Box"": Individual Competence and Fragmented System",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274330,"CSCW research has investigated how people at workplace and organizational settings gain knowledge required for work, but less is known regarding how ""organizational outsiders"" obtain knowledge about organizations and organizational landscapes that provide a service. Gaining knowledge about service landscapes is particularly difficult because they are often complex, non-transparent, and fragmented. We address this gap through an interview study of 19 U.S. parents regarding how they navigated health services for their young children, and how they gained competence in navigation practices. We describe a similar process all participants went through including four inherently iterative stages: seeking and integrating knowledge, decision-making, encountering breakdowns, and repairing and reflecting. We further elucidate what constitutes navigational competence, or the creation of resources about how to navigate, for our participants. We discuss how our study could advance understanding of navigation practices, and the importance for HCI design to support these complex yet essential navigation practices and the accumulation of navigational competence."
Productivity in an Era of Multi-Teaming: The Role of Information Dashboards and Shared Cognition in Team Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274331,"When and why do information dashboards enhance team productivity? We explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. We expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team's transactive memory system (TMS), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. Further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. To test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (Knowledge Worker's Dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. Results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing TMS; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. Potential explanations and implications are discussed."
Social Media as Social Transition Machinery,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274332,"Social media, and people's online self-presentations and social networks, add complexity to people's experiences managing changing identities during life transitions. I use gender transition as a case study to understand how people experience liminality on social media. I qualitatively analyzed data from transition blogs on Tumblr (n=240), a social media blogging site on which people document their gender transitions, and in-depth interviews with transgender bloggers (n=20). I apply ethnographer van Gennep's liminality framework to a social media context and contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that reconstructing one's online identity during life transitions is a rite of passage. During life transitions, people present multiple identities simultaneously on different social media sites that together comprise what I call social transition machinery. Social transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o""en remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life transitions."
Bot Detection in Wikidata Using Behavioral and Other Informal Cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274333,"Bots have been important to peer production's success. Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and Wikidata all have taken advantage of automation to perform work at a rate and scale exceeding that of human contributors. Understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. Yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. We develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. We show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (PR-AUC: 0.845, ROC-AUC: 0.985) and a qualitative analysis of ""anonymous"" contributor edit sessions. We also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. Our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities."
Sociocultural Practices that Make Microfinance Work: A Case Study from Sri Lanka,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274334,"Microfinance is an inherently social process. Over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the ""underbanked"" population in developing countries. This paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural Sri Lanka. Through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. Our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. Using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. We also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. We contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and technology designers. Consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people."
Going Beyond Obscurity: Organizational Approaches to Data Anonymization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274335,"Anonymization is viewed as a solution to over-exposure of personal information in a data-driven society. Yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data for regulatory, ethical or commercial reasons remains underexplored. We investigate how such measures are applied in organizations, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. Our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. Organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. Organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity."
Who is Addressed in this Comment?: Automatically Classifying Meta-Comments in News Comments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274336,"User comments have become an essential part of online journalism. However, newsrooms are often overwhelmed by the vast number of diverse comments, for which a manual analysis is barely feasible. Identifying meta-comments that address or mention newsrooms, individual journalists, or moderators and that may call for reactions is particularly critical. In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. We compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. We develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large German online newsroom SPIEGEL Online and the ""One Million Posts"" corpus of DER STANDARD, an Austrian newspaper. Both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging F0.5 values between 76% and 91%. We report on the most significant classification features with the results of a qualitative analysis and discuss how our work contributes to making participation in online journalism more constructive."
Structure or Nurture?: The Effects of Team-Building Activities and Team Composition on Team Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274337,"How can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. We distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments."
Emotional Biosensing: Exploring Critical Alternatives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274338,"Emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: Data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while CSCW explores new biosensing possibilities. Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience."
Technology to Support Immigrant Access to Social Capital and Adaptation to a New Country,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274339,"The key to successful adaptation for immigrants in a new country is their social capital, or those resources embedded in their social networks. Research suggests that information and communication technologies (ICTs) foster immigrants' social capital and facilitate their adaptation. However, it is unclear how recent immigrants use ICTs to develop social capital and how this supports their adaptation needs. We performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. We found that ICTs and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants' settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. To support recent immigrants' adaptation, we suggest ways for ICTs to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges."
Making a Living My Way: Necessity-driven Entrepreneurship in Resource-Constrained Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274340,"Entrepreneurship has long been used to create self-employment opportunities to guard against career uncertainty. Yet, little is known about how social technologies impact the day-to-day work of entrepreneurs in resource-constrained contexts. We performed a qualitative study involving interviews with 26 micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit and observations of entrepreneurship events. We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit are often pushed into entrepreneurship in response to unexpected life disruptions, barriers to employment, and desire to benefit the community. Their resource-constrained contexts shape how they use social technologies, such as sharing economy tools and social media groups, particularly with respect to privacy, safety, and professional agency. We expand the discussion in CSCW around what it means to be an entrepreneur and provide implications for how social technologies can be designed to better meet the employment needs of people in resource-constrained communities."
Digitizing Monetary Ecologies: Intended and Unintended Consequences of Introducing a Financial Management App in a Low-Resource Setting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274341,"This paper reports on the changes in the monetary ecology around loan payments by auto rickshaw drivers shortly after the introduction of a mobile app in Karnataka, India. A for-profit, social enterprise facilitates loans for purchasing auto rickshaws. The mobile app was designed and implemented to provide accurate, timely loan information for drivers, to support the collaborative work of loan collection payment, and streamline the workflows of the organization. In this paper, we report on the initial experiences with the app, and argue that its introduction led to a tighter coupling of the actors involved and moved control to the back office, which especially impacted the pre- and at-transaction interactions of the monetary ecology. The paper reflects on how these changes impact adoption and use of the app and suggests a number of changes to the design which might address the observed problematics."
Debiasing Desire: Addressing Bias & Discrimination on Intimate Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274342,"Designing technical systems to be resistant to bias and discrimination represents vital new terrain for researchers, policymakers, and the anti-discrimination project more broadly. We consider bias and discrimination in the context of popular online dating and hookup platforms in the United States, which we call intimate platforms. Drawing on work in social-justice-oriented and Queer HCI, we review design features of popular intimate platforms and their potential role in exacerbating or mitigating interpersonal bias. We argue that focusing on platform design can reveal opportunities to reshape troubling patterns of intimate contact without overriding users' decisional autonomy. We identify and address the difficult ethical questions that nevertheless come along with such intervention, while urging the social computing community to engage more deeply with issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion in the study and design of intimate platforms."
Deliberation and Resolution on Wikipedia: A Case Study of Requests for Comments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274343,"Resolving disputes in a timely manner is crucial for any online production group. We present an analysis of Requests for Comments (RfCs), one of the main vehicles on Wikipedia for formally resolving a policy or content dispute. We collected an exhaustive dataset of 7,316 RfCs on English Wikipedia over the course of 7 years and conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis into what issues affect the RfC process. Our analysis was informed by 10 interviews with frequent RfC closers. We found that a major issue affecting the RfC process is the prevalence of RfCs that could have benefited from formal closure but that linger indefinitely without one, with factors including participants' interest and expertise impacting the likelihood of resolution. From these findings, we developed a model that predicts whether an RfC will go stale with 75.3% accuracy, a level that is approached as early as one week after dispute initiation."
Bridging Disconnected Knowledges for Community Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274344,"We conducted a field study of Mohalla Clinics in Delhi (India), drawing on Haraway's work to highlight the importance of considering disparate, partial perspectives in the ecologies of such clinics. We emphasized that inadequate attention given to patients' and health workers' perspectives, and the low preparedness of the doctors at the clinics, resulted in the clinics being unable to address the needs of target patient groups. We concluded by contributing to ongoing, important conversations in the fields of ICTD, CSCW, and HCI towards redesigning healthcare interventions, revisiting patient empowerment, and redefining the role of ASHAs as infomediaries."
Engaging Solidarity in Data Collection Practices for Community Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274345,"Researchers and practitioners engaged in global health are increasingly turning to data-driven approaches. However, the institutionalized roles and responsibilities---as well as motivations and workflows---of those involved in data collection are not well understood. To attain a deeper understanding of the practices of frontline health workers engaged in data collection, we conducted fieldwork in underserved contexts of Delhi, India. In particular, we interviewed these workers and observed their interactions with 200 households. Our analysis takes a postcolonial feminist perspective to examine how these frontline health workers navigate the multiple demands placed on them by their families, society, local residents, and health organizations. We also discuss how they practice feminist solidarity, and distill lessons for improved data collection across global health initiatives."
